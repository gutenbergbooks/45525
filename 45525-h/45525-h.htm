<h3>JOHN FORDHAM&#39;S CONFESSION.</h3>


<p class="p2">My name is John Fordham, and I am thirty-four years of age. So far
as I can judge I am at present of sound mind, though sadly distraught, and my
memory is fairly clear, except as to the occurrences of a certain terrible night
in December two years ago, which are obscured by a black cloud which I have
striven in vain to pierce. These occurrences, and the base use to which they
have been turned by an enemy who has made my life a torture, have brought me to
a pass which will cause me presently to stand before the world as a murderer. No
man accuses me. It is I who accuse myself of the horrible crime, though I call
God to witness that I know not how I came to do it, save that it must have been
done in self-defense. But who will believe me in the face of the damning
evidence which I afterwards found in my possession—and who will believe that
when the fatal deed was done I did not see the features of the man I killed, and
did not know who he was? My protestations will be regarded as weak inventions,
and will be received with incredulity—as probably I should receive them were
another man in my place, and I his judge. It is the guiltiest persons who most
loudly proclaim their innocence, and I shall be classed among them.</p>

<p>Am I, then, weary of life that I deliberately place myself in deadly peril,
and invite the last dread sentence of the law to be passed upon me? In one
sense, yes. Not a day passes that my torturer does not present himself to sting
and threaten me and aggravate my sufferings. My nights are sleepless; even when
exhausted nature drives me into a brief stupor my fevered brain is crowded with
frightful images and visions. So appalling are these fancies that there is a
danger of my being driven mad. Death is preferable.</p>

<p>And yet, but a few moments before I committed the crime, I was looking
forward hopefully to a life of peace and love with a dear and noble woman who
sacrificed her good name for me, and whom I promised to marry when I was freed
from a curse which had clung to me for years. The night was cold, the snow was
falling, but there was joy in my heart, and I walked along singing. Great God!
my heart throbs with anguish as I think of the heaven which might been mine had
not cruel fate suddenly dashed the cup of happiness from my lips. But it is
useless to repine; I yield because it is forced upon me. One consoling thought
is mine. The dear woman I love with a love as true and sincere as ever beat in
the heart of man, will turn to me with pity, will visit me in the prison to
which I go of my own accord, and in the solemn farewell we shall bid one another
will extend her hands and forgive me for the wrong I have done her and our
child.</p>

<p>These last words cause me to waver in my purpose.</p>

<p>Our child! Hers—mine. I am the sweet little fellow&#39;s father. I saw him
yesterday with his mother, though neither he nor my dear Ellen knew that I was
near them, for I was careful they should not see my face. How he has grown!
Yesterday was his fourth &#39;birthday, and to-day Ellen is wondering who left the
toy horse and cart at her lodgings. His sturdy little limbs, his lovely hair,
his large brown eyes with their wonderful lashes, the music of his voice! What
bliss, what torture I endured as I followed and listened to his prattle.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mother!&quot; he cried, dragging at her hand. &quot;Look—look! Do look!&quot;</p>

<p>His excitement was caused by a display of toys in a window, and they stood
together—Ellen and my boy—gazing at the treasures there displayed. He liked
this, he liked that, and wasn&#39;t this grand, and wasn&#39;t that beautiful? and, oh!
look here, mother, and here, and here! He was especially fascinated by the horse
and cart. Very tenderly did Ellen coax his attention to a box of white lambs,
which was to be obtained for sixpence, and they went into the shop, where it Was
placed in his arms, for his little hands could not grasp it firmly, and he
wanted to carry it home himself. As he and his mother walked away I observed him
look longingly over his shoulder at the horse and cart, and doubtless there was
in his young mind a hope that one of these fine days when he was a big, big man
such a treasure might also be in his possession, and that he would be able to
ride off in it straight to fairyland. I am sure Ellen would have given it to him
could she have afforded it, but she is obliged to be economical and sparing with
her pennies. She earns a trifle by needlework, and, through a solicitor, she
receives a pound a week from me, whom she believes to be thousands of miles
away. Upon this she lives in modest comfort, saving every penny she can, and
looking forward cheerfully to the future. The future! Alas for her—for
Reggie—for me!</p>

<p>Reggie&#39;s father hanged for murder! But he need never know. He does not bear
my name, for Ellen would not have it so. &quot;Not till the laws of God and man
sanction it,&quot; she said, and I let her have her way. Spirit of truth and justice!
Show me the path wherein my duty lies.</p>

<p>More than one path is open to me. I could disappear at sea beneath the
waters, and my enemy would never discover how and by what means I had severed
the cord of life. He would hunt for me, and gnash his teeth at the escape of his
prey. Some satisfaction in that. Oh, miserable fool, to express such a
sentiment! But let it stand. I have no desire to conceal my weaknesses. Being
gone, Ellen would still receive her pound a week. This is secured to her, and it
is this my enemy would snatch from her. &quot;You have money left,&quot; he cried. &quot;I will
have my share of it, or I will denounce you.&quot; He shall not succeed. He shall not
rob Ellen, nor shall he denounce me. No man except myself shall bring me to the
bar of justice.</p>

<p>I could kill him, and the world would be rid of a monster. I am strong; he is
weak. I have held him with one hand, so that he could not move a step from the
spot upon which he stood. Dead, he could do no more mischief. Wretch that I am!
Add murder to murder? No. I will not burden my soul with conscious guilt.</p>

<p>I will do what I resolved to do, and this confession, when it is completed,
shall be sent to Ellen. Condemn me, world. Ellen, in my last hours I look to you
for one blessed ray of light. There was a dread crisis in my life when you were
my guardian angel, and saved me from destruction. You will not fail me now.
Receiving consolation at your dear hands, from your pure heart, I shall lay down
my load, and with sobs of thankfulness shall bid the world farewell. In heaven,
where the truth is known, we shall meet again.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>

<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession2" href="#ch02">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Were it not necessary I would make no mention of my child-life,
but this record would be incomplete were I to pass it over in silence. All that
I can do is to dwell upon it as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>My mother died a few weeks after I was born; my father waited but twelve
months before he married again, and in less than two years his second wife was a
widow. Thus I lost both my parents at too early an age to retain the slightest
recollection of them. By his second marriage my father had one child, a boy; my
half-brother&#39;s name was Louis, and by him and my stepmother I was regarded with
aversion—by her, indeed, with a much stronger feeling, for when I was old enough
to reason out things for myself I learned that she hated me.</p>

<p>My father had made a fortune by commerce, and in his will he behaved justly
to those who had a claim upon him. Half of his fortune was left to his widow,
without restriction of any kind except that she was to rear and educate me, and
that her home was to be mine until I was twenty-one years of age; then I was to
become entitled to my share, one-fourth, which was so securely invested and
protected that she could not touch it. The remaining one-fourth was left to
Louis in the same way. Two of my father&#39;s friends were appointed trustees, to
see to the proper disposition of his children&#39;s inheritance.</p>

<p>In the conditions of this will my stepmother found a double cause for
resentment. She was angry in the first place that the whole of the fortune was
not bequeathed to her, and in the second place that she was not appointed
trustee; and she visited her anger upon me, an unoffending child, who could have
had no hand in what she conceived to be a plot against her. Upon her son she
lavished a full measure of passionate love, while I was allowed to roam about,
neglected and uncared for. Nothing was too good for Louis, nothing too bad for
me. He had the best room in the house to sleep in, I the worst; he was always
beautifully dressed, and I was made to wear his cast-off clothes. It was the
breast of the fowl for Louis, the drumstick for me, and dainty dishes were
prepared for him which I was not allowed to taste; my meals were measured out,
and if I asked for more I was refused. He was taken to theatres and
entertainments, I was left at home. His Christmas trees were at once a delight
and a torture to me. They could not prevent me from looking and longing, but not
a toy fell to my share. The heartless woman told me that I had robbed her and
her son of their inheritance, and I have no doubt that she had nursed this
grievance into a conviction. &quot;You are nothing but a pest and a nuisance,&quot; she
said. And as a pest and a nuisance I was treated. In these circumstances it
would have been strange indeed if my child-life had been happy.</p>

<p>I was glad when I was sent to school, and I did not look forward to the
holidays with any feeling of pleasure. Studious by nature, I did well at school,
and good reports of my progress were sent home, which my stepmother tore up
before my face. Notwithstanding this systematic oppression I strove to win
affection from her and Louis, but every advance I made met with cold repulse,
the result being that we became less and less friendly. At length I gave up the
attempt, and suffering from a sense of injustice preserved my self-respect by an
assertion of independence. Instead of bending meekly beneath the lash, I stood
up boldly, and seized and broke it. This really happened. One scene, which lives
in my memory, will serve as an illustration.</p>

<p>I do not say it in praise of myself, because these things come by nature, but
I have a tender feeling towards all living creatures, and cannot bear to see
them tortured. To Louis it was a delight, and even his pets did not escape when
he grew tired of them. He had some white rabbits, and one day I saw him bind all
the limbs of one of them round its body till it resembled a ball in form. Then
he threw it high in the air again and again, and frequently failing to catch it
the poor thing fell upon the gravel path in the garden till it was covered with
blood. I was fourteen years of age at the time, Louis was twelve. I darted
forward, and picking up the wounded animal was loosening its bonds, when he
snatched it from me. I endeavored to take it from him, telling him it was cruel
to torture the helpless creature. We had a struggle, and his screams brought his
mother from the house. She fell upon me, and dragged me away.</p>

<p>&quot;See what he has done,&quot; said Louis, pointing to the bleeding rabbit, which
had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;You did it,&quot; I retorted.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a lie,&quot; he screamed. &quot;You did it, you did it.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not the first falsehood he had told by many to get me into trouble.
Panting with rage, my stepmother ran back to the house, and returned with a cane
she had often used upon me.</p>

<p>&quot;I will punish you for the lie,&quot; she said. &quot;How dare you say my darling would
do such a cruel thing? You are a disgrace to the name you bear.&quot;</p>

<p>She flourished the cane; I stepped back.</p>

<p>&quot;I have told the truth,&quot; I said, &quot;and I don&#39;t intend to be punished any more
by you for faults I do not commit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not intend!&quot; she answered, advancing towards me. &quot;I will teach you; I
will teach you!&quot;</p>

<p>Swish went the cane across my face; only once, for as she was about to repeat
the blow I wrested it from her, broke it, and threw it over the garden wall. In
a frenzy of ungovernable fury she seized the first weapon that caught her eye—a
gardener&#39;s spade—and attacked me with it, and at the same moment Louis ran at me
with a three-pronged rake. He slipped and fell, and in his fall wounded himself
with the prongs. His cries of pain diverted his mother&#39;s attention from me; she
flung away the spade, and caught him in her arms. Alarmed at the sight of blood
dripping from his face I stepped forward to assist her.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep off, you murderer!&quot; she shrieked. &quot;You have killed my boy! You will
come to the gallows!&quot;</p>

<p>She flew into the house with Louis, and I saw nothing more of her that day.
Louis, as I afterwards learned, kept his room for a week; it was not till months
had passed that we met again, and then I noticed a scar on his forehead which I
was told he would carry with him to the grave. From that time I was made to feel
that I had two bitter enemies in my father&#39;s house. Arrangements were made to
keep me at school during holidays, and I was not sorry for it. Once a year only
was I allowed to visit my home, and then I was shunned; my meals were served to
me in a separate room, and not the slightest attention was paid to my wants. I
grew to be accustomed to this, and took refuge in study, longing for the day to
arrive when I should be free. I recall the conversation which took place on that
day between my stepmother and me.</p>

<p>&quot;You have made arrangements, I presume,&quot; she commenced, &quot;for residing
elsewhere?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been thinking what I had best do,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;That is not what I asked you. It is perfectly immaterial to me what you have
been thinking of. I presume your arrangements to live elsewhere are already
made.&quot;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact they were not, but I could not pretend to misunderstand
her.</p>

<p>&quot;You wish me to leave the house soon?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;At once,&quot; she replied, &quot;without a moment&#39;s unnecessary delay. You shall not
eat another meal here. Your presence is hateful to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have known that all my life,&quot; I said, mournfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why have you remained so long?&quot; she asked, speaking with angry
vehemence. &quot;A man with a particle of spirit in him would have gone away years
ago, but you, like the creature you are, have sponged upon me to the last hour.
You are twenty-one to-day, and I am no longer legally obliged to keep you. Go,
and disgrace yourself, as you are sure to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall never do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has to be proved,&quot; she retorted. &quot;As if any one knowing you would believe
a word that passes your lips! We shall see your name in the papers in connection
with some scandalous affair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mistaken. I bear my father&#39;s name, and I would suffer a hundred
deaths rather than see it dragged through the mire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Swear it,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;I swear it. But, hating me as you do, why should you be so sensitive about
my good name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your good name!&quot; she said, scornfully. &quot;It is only because I bear it,
because Louis bears it, as well as you, that I exact the pledge from you.
Otherwise, do you think I care what becomes of you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly,&quot; I said, &quot;I believe it would rejoice you to hear the worst.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would.&quot; %</p>

<p>&quot;I hope to disappoint you. On my solemn word of honor nothing that I do shall
ever make our name a theme for scandal or reproach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hold you to that. We shall see whether there is any manhood in you, or the
least sense of honor. Now, go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cannot we part without enmity?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>Persecuted and wronged as I had been, some touch of sentiment—of which I was
not ashamed—moved me to the endeavor to soften the heart of my dead father&#39;s
wife.</p>

<p>&quot;No, we cannot,&quot; she answered. &quot;To ask it proves your mean spirit. But do you
think we shall forget you? We have something to remember you by Be sure—be sure
that it will not be forgotten while there is blood in our veins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To what do you refer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a scar on my Louis&#39; face inflicted by you, which he will bear with
him to the grave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; I cried. &quot;It is not true to say I did it. I deplore the accident,
but it was caused by his own cruelty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you utter the lie? It is not the first time; you said as much on
the day you tried to kill him. Yes, you would have murdered him had I not been
by. We shall remember you by that, and it shall be evidence against you if there
is ever occasion for it. Cruelty! My darling Louis cruel! He has the tenderest
heart. You coward—you coward! Had he been as old and strong as you you would not
have dared to attack him. But that is the way with such as you—to strike only
the weak. Time will show—time will show! You are going into the world; there is
no longer a check upon you. There will be a woman, perhaps, whom you will beat
and torture. Oh, yes, you will do it; and you will lie to the world and whine
that the fault is hers. Let those who stand by her come to me and Louis—we will
give you a character; you shall be exposed in your true light. I hate you—I hate
you—I hate you! May your life be a life of sorrow!&quot;</p>

<p>And she flung herself from the room.</p>

<p>The time was to come when these cruel words were to be used against me with
cruel effect; there was something prophetic in their venom.</p>

<p>I did not see Louis before I left the house, and on that day I commenced a
new life.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:2em"><a name="confession3" href="#ch03">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>For three years it was uneventful. I lived much alone, and made a few
friends, with one or another of whom I took a holiday every year on the
Continent. Then an event occurred which gave birth to the startling incidents
and experiences of my life.</p>

<p>Ten years ago this month Barbara Landor and I were married. I was
twenty-four, and Barbara was three years my senior. To a young man in love—as I
must have been at that time, though my feelings for my wife soon underwent
change, and I look back upon them now with amazement—such a disparity is not
likely to cause uneasiness. It did not cause me any. I was swayed entirely by my
passionate desire to make the woman with whom I was infatuated my wife.</p>

<p>I had known her only a short time before I proposed, and was accepted. Our
engagement was of but a few weeks&#39; duration, and during our courtship I observed
nothing in Barbara&#39;s manner to disturb me. No one warned me; no friend bade me
pause before I bound myself irrevocably to a woman who was to be my ruin.
Occasionally her face was rather flushed, and she was eager and nervous, which I
ascribed to the excitement of our engagement. Her sparkling eyes, her rapid
speech, the occasional trembling of her hands—all this I set down to love. She
confided to me that she had no fortune, and that she had thought of seeking
employment as a governess or as a companion to a lady. She possessed great
gifts, which, of course, I magnified; she was a good musician, could speak
French, German and Italian fluently, and sang to me in those languages with a
rich contralto voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Had it not been for you,&quot; she said, &quot;I might even have got into the chorus
at the opera.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is not this better?&quot; I asked, embracing her.</p>

<p>&quot;Much better,&quot; she replied, returning my embrace.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman, dark, tall, and commanding, and her nearest
relative was a half-brother, Maxwell, much older than she, for whom I had no
special liking. Naturally, after I had drawn from Barbara an avowal of her love,
I addressed myself to him. He stood towards her in the light of a guardian, and
she was living in his house. In reply to his questions I was very candid as to
my worldly position and prospects, and he professed himself satisfied; but I
remembered afterwards that when I came courting his sister he would look at me
with an expression of amusement on his features, as though he was enjoying a
joke he was keeping to himself. He was in the habit of boasting that he was a
man of the world, and knew every trick on the board. It was chiefly at his
urging that the marriage was precipitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Long engagements are a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39;t you think so?&quot;</p>

<p>I replied that I was entirely of his opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;That simplifies matters,&quot; he said, &quot;because I am going abroad. I shall not
take a sister with me, you may depend upon that.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a plain hint, and the wedding day was fixed. Soon after this, when I
called to do my wooing, he told me that Barbara was not well enough to see me.</p>

<p>&quot;She has a frightful headache,&quot; he said, &quot;and is not in a condition to see
anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>I was much distressed, and I asked if she had a doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;Not necessary,&quot; he said. &quot;She will get over it. When she is in that state
best leave her alone, old fellow. There&#39;s a hint for you in your matrimonial
campaign. Barbara hates the sight of doctors; she is a delicate creature, very
highly strung, something of the full-blooded racer about her, the kind of woman
that requires managing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be able to manage her,&quot; I said confidently.</p>

<p>&quot;I should think you would,&quot; he said, with a mocking smile. &quot;Barbara and you
are going to have a high old time of it. By the way, can you lend me a tenner
for a few days?&quot;</p>

<p>It was not the first time he had asked me for a loan, which was always to be
paid in a few days; but he never returned a shilling of the money he borrowed
from me. I gave him the ten pounds, and inwardly resolved to have as little as
possible to do with him after my marriage.</p>

<p>I debated with myself whether I should communicate the news of my engagement
to my stepmother and Louis, and acting upon the advice of Barbara—to whom I gave
a truthful relation of my child-life—I wrote to them in affectionate terms. To
me no answer was returned, but Barbara received a letter which she told me she
tore up the moment she read it.</p>

<p>&quot;Your stepmother must be an awful woman,&quot; she said, &quot;but we can do without
her and her beautiful son.&quot;</p>

<p>It was very considerate of Barbara, I thought, not to show me the letter, the
tenor of which it was not difficult to guess, but I could not help looking
grave.</p>

<p>&quot;No long faces, you dear boy,&quot; cried Barbara. &quot;Do you think I believe a word
she says? Do you think I care for any one but you? If she hadn&#39;t been the
meanest creature living she would at least have sent a wedding present.&quot;</p>

<p>The wedding was a very quiet one. A friend acted as my best man, and a few
other of my friends were present. On Barbara&#39;s side there was only Maxwell, who
gave his sister away. She looked beautiful, and was in high spirits. The
ceremony over we hastened to Maxwell&#39;s house, where I and my friends expected to
sit down to a wedding breakfast. To my surprise there was nothing on the table
but the bridecake and a couple of bottles of wine. It was not a time to ask for
an explanation of this inhospitable welcome to the wedding guests, but I was
deeply mortified, and I saw that my friends were angry and offended. Maxwell
made light of the matter; he filled the glasses, and in a florid speech proposed
the health of bride and bridegroom, to which I responded very briefly.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing else to wait for, I suppose,&quot; said my best man, in a
sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>No one answered him, and with shrugs and halfhearted wishes for happiness he
and the other guests took their departure, leaving Barbara and me and Maxwell
alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t quarrel with him,&quot; Barbara whispered to me; &quot;he has the most awful
temper.&quot;</p>

<p>For her sake I put the best face I could upon the slight that had been passed
upon me. Maxwell appeared to be unconscious that he had behaved in any way
offensively; he drank a great deal of wine, and urged Barbara to drink, but she
refused.</p>

<p>&quot;A glass with me, darling,&quot; I said. &quot;To our future.&quot;</p>

<p>She raised the glass to her lips, and set it down, untasted, with a shudder.
I had noticed at the meals we three had together that she drank nothing but
water.</p>

<p>&quot;You do not like wine?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I detest it,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll drink your share whenever you call upon me,&quot; shouted Maxwell. &quot;She is
quite right, isn&#39;t she, John? Milk for women, wine for men.&quot;</p>

<p>He was getting intoxicated, and began to troll out a song about wine and
women. I strove to quiet him, but he went on laughing hilariously. Excited and
enraged, I quickly emptied my glass, and was about to drink again, when Barbara
laid her hand upon my arm. I put the full glass upon the table, at which
Maxwell, who had been observing us, laughed louder still.</p>

<p>&quot;Maxwell!&quot; cried Barbara, angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara!&quot; cried Maxwell, with his bold eyes upon her. &quot;Well, my lady?&quot;</p>

<p>They looked strangely at one another, and it was Barbara who first lowered
her eyes. There was something threatening in Maxwell&#39;s glance, and she seemed to
be frightened of him. I was not sorry, for I accepted it as an indication that
she would side with me in my desire not to court his society when we returned
from our honeymoon trip. We were to start for the Continent in the evening, and
there were still two or three hours before us. To pass this interval of time in
Maxwell&#39;s company was not a pleasant prospect, but I scarcely knew how to avoid
it. He evinced no disposition to leave Barbara and me together, and I felt
awkward and out of place, and really as if it was I who was intruding. The house
was his, and in a certain sense we were his guests. A bright idea occurred to
me. I proposed that Barbara should dress for our journey, and that we should go
and lunch at an hotel. Barbara, however, said she could not eat, and Maxwell
cried boisterously:</p>

<p>&quot;What are you thinking of, brother-in-law? A newborn bride sitting down to
eat at an hotel on her wedding day. She would sink to the ground in shame,
wouldn&#39;t she, Barbara? But I accept your invitation with pleasure, my boy. I am
famished, and you must be. I insist upon you fortifying yourself; it is a duty
you owe to Barbara and to society at large. With what is before you, it is
absolutely necessary that you should keep up your strength. Take my word for it;
I&#39;m an older bird than you. Let us go. Barbara will nibble a biscuit, or make a
meal off a butterfly&#39;s wing, if she can catch one.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned to Barbara, and she whispered that it would be best. She was tired
and would lie down while we were away. I saw that she was weary, and disgusted
with her brother&#39;s behavior, so to save her from further annoyance, I consented
to go with Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like to leave you for a moment, darling,&quot; I said, &quot;but I must get
him away. I shall be back in good time; be sure you are ready.&quot;</p>

<p>I said this smilingly, as if I referred to woman&#39;s proverbial failing in
seldom being ready at an appointed time when she has to dress for a journey or a
dinner, or anything, in fact.</p>

<p>She did not return smile for smile. In a weak, helpless way she clung to me
for a moment, and then abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, turtle doves, turtle doves!&quot; exclaimed Maxwell, hooking his arm in mine,
as we walked along. &quot;Oh, golden day, with love&#39;s fetters binding one fast!
Auspicious epoch in a man&#39;s career when he is strung up for life! Love, honor,
and obey, and all that sort of thing. Connubial bliss, Darby and Joan, till
death doth us part. Not for me, my boy, not for me; but every man to his taste.
Fol-de-riddle! Chorus of infatuated bridegrooms—fol-de-riddle, fol-de-riddle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold your tongue,&quot; I said, between my teeth, &quot;or I&#39;ll not stay with you
another moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right you are, my sensitive plant,&quot; he returned. &quot;I&#39;m mum as the inside of a
screwed down coffin.&quot;</p>

<p>But he continued to sing softly to himself, and to chuckle as he cast furtive
glances at me. In such circumstances it was not likely that I could enjoy my
meal, and I sat for the most part doing nothing, while Maxwell disposed of the
various courses he ordered. Drinking did not affect his appetite, and he would
have kept at the table all the day had I not called for the bill.</p>

<p>&quot;Time to go, eh? Love&#39;s call must be obeyed,&quot; he said, rising, and pouring
out the last glass of wine in the bottle. With his left hand on the table he
steadied himself, and held up the glass.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re not half a bad sort, John, but you&#39;re a bit soft. You want hardening,
my boy, and you&#39;ll get it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;What do I mean? Why, that Barbara&#39;s all your own now, all your own. Well,
here&#39;s a happy honeymoon to the fond couple.&quot; He drained the glass.</p>

<p>I hardly knew how to take his words, and I did not answer him. On our way
back he borrowed twenty pounds of me, and I determined it should be the last he
would ever get from me. I was strongly inclined at first to refuse, but I was
afraid he would make a scene, and so for Barbara&#39;s sake I gave him the money.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, John,&quot; he said, pocketing the notes. &quot;You&#39;re a trump, but a
trifle green. Here we are at the house. What a jolly wedding-day!&quot;</p>

<p>I could have struck the mocking devil in the face, for by this time I was
thoroughly out of temper; but, again for dear Barbara&#39;s sake, I refrained from
uttering the hot words that rose to my lips.</p>

<p>The carriage was at the door and my wife was ready. Maxwell opened his arms
for a parting embrace, but Barbara slipped from him and entered the carriage. As
it moved away I caught a last glimpse of him standing on the doorstep laughing
immoderately, and I almost fancied I heard him call after us, &quot;What a jolly
wedding day!&quot;</p>

<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession4" href="#ch04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The next day we were in Paris. We had a miserable crossing and two
miserable railway journeys. On neither of the lines could I get a compartment to
ourselves, both the French and English trains being crowded to excess. On the
steamboat Barbara was very ill, and I gave her into the charge of the
stewardess, being too unwell myself to attend to her. We were not, as may be
imagined, a very cheerful couple, nor was this a cheerful commencement of our
honeymoon. I did my best, however, to keep up Barbara&#39;s spirits, but she
continued to be sad and despondent, and did not rally till we reached the gay
city. The bright sunshine and the animation of the streets did wonders for us. I
held her hand in mine as we drove to the hotel in which I had engaged rooms, and
life assumed a joyful aspect. The color came again to Barbara&#39;s cheeks, the
sparkle to her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;The worst is over, dearest,&quot; I said, &quot;and we are together—and alone.&quot;</p>

<p>She pressed my hand fondly.</p>

<p>Was I really in love? I cannot answer. The fire of youth was in my veins, the
light of hope was in my heart. Call it what you will—love, passion,
desire—Barbara was all in all to me, and our fond endearments caused the hours
to fly at lightning speed. The embarrassments and mortifications of yesterday
were forgotten; to-day was ours, to enjoy. We dined at the hotel, by Barbara&#39;s
plate a caraffe of iced water, by mine a bottle of old Burgundy. At nine
o&#39;clock, knowing that Barbara had some unpacking to do—for it was my intention
to remain in Paris a week—I said that I would take a stroll in the streets, and
would return at ten.</p>

<p>&quot;It will take me quite two hours,&quot; she said, with a trembling eagerness in
her voice, &quot;to get my boxes in order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will return at eleven,&quot; I said gaily, kissing her.</p>

<p>I strolled through the brilliantly lighted streets in a dream of delight.
There was no Maxwell near to disturb me with his mocking laughter. Barbara was
her bright self again, and she and I were &quot;man and wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Man and wife,&quot; I murmured. &quot;Nothing can come between us now, nothing can
separate us. She is mine forever. I am really a married man.&quot;</p>

<p>I saw in the window of a jeweler&#39;s shop a brooch with two hearts entwined. It
was emblematical of Barbara&#39;s heart and mine, and I went in and purchased it,
and purchased also at a florist&#39;s a bouquet of the loveliest flowers. It was now
ten o&#39;clock, and I had still an hour to myself. A long time to carry a large
bouquet of flowers amidst a throng of people, but what cared I? Why should I
hide my happiness? Was I not proud of my beautiful Barbara, whose pure and
innocent heart I had won, and whose sweet companionship would brighten my days
till we were both old and white-haired? Let the whole world know that the
flowers were for my bride—let the whole world know that I was in love. Was not
this the city of love? The hum of merry voices proclaimed it—the myriad stars,
the soft air, the brilliant lights, the animated gestures of men and women, all
proclaimed it. There were no dark shadows to blot the bright picture; joy was
universal; there was no sadness, no death, no cankered care to wither the glad
hopes of the future—all was light and love.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eleven I hastened to the hotel of which she was the sun, and
paced the boulevard a few yards this way, a few yards that, and strolled into
the courtyard, and looked at my watch, and impatiently counted the seconds, and
fretted and fumed until the minute hand reached eleven. Then I eagerly mounted
the stairs, and entered our sitting-room.</p>

<p>The lights were burning, and the room had a cheerful appearance. A
communicating door led to the bedroom, and I listened at this door a moment, but
heard no sound from within. I arranged the bouquet of flowers in a vase, which I
filled with water, and then I turned out the lights, with the intention of
entering our bridal chamber. But the door was fast. I tried very softly again
and again to open it, and then with greater force, but it would not yield.</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara,&quot; I called in a low tone, &quot;it is I. Why have you locked the door?&quot;</p>

<p>No answer reached my ears. I called several times, with the same result. Long
before this I had become alarmed, and had re-lit the gas in the sitting-room.
Stories of dark crimes committed in this city of light flashed through my mind.
The door was locked, but that might be a blind. It was scarcely possible that
Barbara could be in the room; she had been decoyed from the hotel upon some
pretense, perhaps by the delivery of a false message from me. If so, what would
be her fate? And even supposing her to be in her room, how to account for the
frightful silence? Fool, criminal that I was to leave her alone, a hapless woman
in a strange city! It was I, and I alone, who had brought the woman I loved into
this perilous position.</p>

<p>I rushed down to the manager of the hotel, and asked if any visitors had been
admitted into my rooms during my absence, or any message delivered to my wife.
The manager, who was the soul of politeness, and who was smoking a cigarette
after the labors of the day, made inquiries of the concierge and of the servants
who had not retired to rest. No person had called to see madame; no message had
been taken to her; she had not been seen to leave the hotel. Had she rung for
refreshment or assistance? No. Had any sounds of disturbance been heard in her
apartment? No, the apartment had been perfectly quiet. Were they certain that
madame could not have left the hotel without being seen? It was not possible.
She would have had to pass through the courtyard, and the concierge or an
assistant was constantly on the watch, noting who came and who went. Then, how
to account for the facts of her bedroom door being locked and of her not
answering to my call? The servants could not account for it; the manager could
not account for it. With profuse apologies he hazarded a question. Was madame
subject to fainting fits? Was it that she had swooned? With my permission he
would accompany me to the apartment, and together we could ascertain.</p>

<p>We ascertained nothing; we discovered no clue to the mystery. The door defied
all our efforts to open it, and no reply was given to our summons. The suspense
was maddening.</p>

<p>&quot;See, monsieur,&quot; said the manager, stooping, and putting his eye to the
key-hole, &quot;the door is locked from within. The key is in the lock. Be tranquil;
madame is safe; she has fallen into a sound sleep. I myself sleep so soundly
that——&quot;</p>

<p>I interrupted him impatiently.</p>

<p>&quot;If my wife has fallen asleep she must be awakened.&quot;</p>

<p>He did not see the necessity; if I would be patient madame would herself
awake when she had slept enough; then all would be well.</p>

<p>&quot;My wife must be awakened,&quot; I repeated vehemently.</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; he then said, falling complacently into my humor. &quot;If you
insist, monsieur, madame must be awakened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how?&quot; I cried, in a fever of anxiety, which with every passing moment
grew more intense.</p>

<p>&quot;As monsieur says,&quot; he replied, with exasperating coolness, &quot;but how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The lock must be forced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A million pardons, monsieur. The lock of the door is of a particular kind.
It is not a common lock—no, no. It was put on especially for a distinguished
visitor, who frequently occupies this apartment. It is what is called a patent
lock, and is the property of our distinguished visitor. I cannot consent that it
shall be forced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we will have a piece cut out of the door. By that means we can reach
the key, and turn the lock from within.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again a million pardons. The door is of oak; it was made for our
distinguished visitor. I cannot consent, monsieur, that the door shall be
destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hang you! Stand aside!&quot;</p>

<p>I pushed him away, and applied my shoulder to the door. I was young, I was
strong, but I might as well have set myself against a rock. The door held firm
and fast, and the noise I made did not arouse Barbara. Even in the midst of my
despair I heard the manager remark, &quot;These eccentric English!&quot; Finding my
efforts vain, I beat the panels with my fists. A servant entered, and whispered
to the manager.</p>

<p>&quot;Desist, monsieur,&quot; he said, stepping forward, &quot;you are disturbing our
visitors. It cannot be permitted. In the adjoining apartment is a sick
gentleman. He has already inquired whether there is a fire or an earthquake. If
monsieur pleases, there is another way.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it? Quick—quick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The window of madame&#39;s room looks out upon a courtyard at the back. It is
easily reached by a ladder. The night is warm; madame may have left her window
unfastened——&quot;</p>

<p>I stopped any further explanation by hurrying him to the courtyard at the
back. On the way he insisted upon informing me that the hotel was of the highest
character and eminently respectable. No robbery had ever taken place in it; no
crime had ever been committed within its walls. Madame was fatigued by her
journey, and had probably taken an opiate. I should find her asleep in her bed
quite safe—quite safe.</p>

<p>&quot;The ladder—the ladder!&quot; I cried, in a frenzy. &quot;Where is the ladder?&quot;</p>

<p>It was soon brought—though I thought it an age before it was fixed against
the wall—and a porter commenced to ascend. But I pulled him back with a rough
hand, and said I would go up myself. &quot;These eccentric English!&quot; I heard the
manager again remark to those assembled around him.</p>

<p>His surmise was correct. The window was closed but not fastened; I pushed it
open and stepped into the room.</p>

<p>It was dark, but by the light admitted through the open window I saw the form
of my wife huddled upon the bed. I laid my hands upon her and called,
&quot;Barbara—dear Barbara!&quot; A faint moan was the only response.</p>

<p>&quot;Great God!&quot; I cried. &quot;She is dying!&quot;</p>

<p>I swiftly lighted the gas, and the room was flooded with light. Then I
discovered the horrible truth. An empty brandy bottle rolled from the bed to the
floor, and on the dressing table was a corkscrew with the cork still in it. The
cork was new, and the bright capsule by its side denoted that the bottle must
have been full when it had been opened. I bent over Barbara&#39;s stupefied form,
the fumes of liquor which tainted her hot breath were sickening. My wife was not
dying. She was drunk!</p>

<p>The whole room was in a state of disorder; the bed curtains were torn,
articles of feminine attire were scattered about, brushes and combs and other
toilet requisites had been swept from the table, a chair had been upset; but at
that moment I took little note of these signs, my attention being centred upon
the degrading human spectacle which lay before me on the bed—my wife, the woman
I had idealized as an embodiment of purity and simplicity.</p>

<p>I was not allowed to remain long undisturbed; I heard a smart rapping at the
bedroom door, and I became instantly conscious that I had a new part to play. I
closed and fastened the window, and drew the curtains across it, I lowered the
gas almost to vanishing point, and then, turning the key in the lock, I opened
the door just wide enough to see the manager&#39;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is safe?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite safe,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;As I said. Asleep?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I said. There has been no crime or robbery?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There has been no crime or robbery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And madame is well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I trust you are satisfied, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfectly satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is anything more required?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No assistance of any kind? The chambermaid is here. Shall she attend to
madame?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her assistance is not needed. Good-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-night, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>As he and the attendants left the adjoining room, I heard him remark for the
third time, &quot;These eccentric English!&quot;</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession5" href="#ch05">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The first thing I did was to securely bolt and lock every door, to
darken every window that gave access to our rooms. I must be alone with my shame
and my grief. No one must know—the secret of this vile, this unutterable
disgrace must not escape, must not be whispered, must not be suspected. From the
friends who had been present at the wedding ceremony I could not expect sympathy
after the way in which they had been treated; from strangers I could hope for
none; by friends and strangers alike I should be pointed at and derided. I must
wear a false face to all the world—as false as the face my wife had worn to me
during our courtship. For in the first flush of the frightful discovery I did
not stop to palter with myself, I did not attempt to disguise the truth, to
delude myself with the hope that this was a new experience in Barbara&#39;s
character. The fatal truth fastened itself in my heart. Signs which had borne no
baneful significance in the past were now suddenly and rightfully interpreted. I
understood Maxwell&#39;s mocking words and laughter:</p>

<p>&quot;You want hardening, my boy, and you&#39;ll get it,&quot; he had said, Again, &quot;Barbara
is not in a condition to see anybody. When she is in that state, best leave her,
old fellow. There&#39;s a hint for you in your matrimonial campaign.&quot; And then his
last derisive exclamation, &quot;What a jolly wedding day!&quot; The meaning of the looks
he and Barbara had exchanged on that day when we three were together after the
ceremony, was now clear to me, as clear and withering as a blasting lightning
stroke. She was a drunkard, and he was keeping the joke from me. His look
conveyed the threat, &quot;Be careful, or I will betray you.&quot; Aye, betray her before
she betrayed herself! The momentary defiance in her eyes died away, and she
trembled in his presence.</p>

<p>&quot;I will betray you!&quot; Good God, how I had been betrayed! Barbara was mine
forever; as Maxwell had said, she was all my own. We were linked together; our
fates were united. There were no separate paths which each could tread apart
from the other. Hand in hand we must take our way, and death alone could tear us
asunder. On my honor as a man there died within me during those few moments of
torturing reflection all the love I had borne for Barbara. I awoke to the fact
that it was not true love, but animal passion for her beauty, that had led me
into this pit of shame and despair.</p>

<p>Some men arrive, by slow and devious roads, at a belief that shakes their
faith to its foundations. Not so I. As surely as I knew that I lived and moved
did I know that I was wedded to a drunkard, and that there was no civilized law
that could divorce me from her. I was Barbara&#39;s shield and protector, her lord,
her master, her victim. Her claim upon me was not to be evaded; even to dispute
it would cover me with ignominy, would make my name a bye-word. I could not
break the fetters of the law which bound us together and made us one. Had
Barbara not been a confirmed drunkard, she could never have drank a full bottle
of brandy in so short a time. Three or four glasses would have overcome her, and
she could not have continued to tipple.</p>

<p>Think what you will of me, I declare that I had no compassion for the woman I
had married. No pity for her stirred my heart. Perfect in its devilish cunning
was the duplicity she had practised. &quot;You do not like wine?&quot; I had said to her.
&quot;I detest it,&quot; she had answered; and never in my presence had she drank anything
except water. Most artfully had she concealed from me a secret which was to
wreck all my hopes of happiness, which was to shut out from me all the pure and
innocent pleasures which a man at my time of life might naturally look forward
to. What pity could I have for one who had done this evil?</p>

<p>I made no attempt to rouse my wife, not because I feared I should not
succeed, but because I had no desire to restore her to consciousness and to hold
converse with her. I needed time to review more calmly the position in which I
was placed and to decide upon my course of action in the future. Meanwhile I
applied myself to an examination of the bedroom. One of Barbara&#39;s trunks was
unlocked; the lid was down, but a litter of feminine apparel on the floor
denoted that it had been hurriedly opened and the articles of clothing as
hurriedly snatched from the top, with no intention, as Barbara had indicated, of
putting her things in order, but rather of getting quickly at something which
lay beneath. Had I the right to search this trunk? was the question I mentally
put to myself. I did not, however, stop to discuss it. Right or wrong, I raised
the lid, and taking out the garments which first met my eyes I found beneath
them damning proofs of Barbara&#39;s degradation. Five bottles of brandy were
brought to light—the one she had emptied made the sixth. She had provided
herself liberally, sufficient for six days at the rate she had commenced.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to throw them out of the window, but I checked myself in
time. The noise of the broken glass would have brought the manager and his staff
buzzing about me. What should I do with the cursed things? Leave them in her
trunk? No; it would be inviting a series of disgraceful exhibitions such as that
which lay within my view. From me she would receive no assistance to reach a
lower depth than that into which she had fallen. I could at least make it
difficult for her to obtain her next supply of liquor without my knowledge, so I
carried the bottles to the outer room, and secreted them in one of my own
trunks, determining to get rid of them by some means in the course of the next
few hours. Then I huddled Barbara&#39;s clothes into her trunk, and closed the lid.
Without casting another glance at my wife, who was now beginning to breathe more
heavily, I returned to the sitting-room, and sinking into a chair, burst into a
passionate fit of weeping.</p>

<p>Thus did I pass my bridal night.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession6" href="#ch06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">At seven in the morning I heard my wife shifting restlessly and
moaning in her bedroom. I had not had a moment&#39;s sleep during the night. My eyes
closed occasionally from weariness, but sleep did not come to me; nor did I woo
it, for I felt the necessity of keeping awake, lest Barbara should create a
disturbance. Her condition was a new and bitter experience to me, and I did not
know what form it might take. In whatever form it presented itself I must be
prepared to cope with it; and it behoved me, therefore, to keep on the watch.</p>

<p>I paid no attention to Barbara&#39;s moans, but went to my dressing-room and
bathed my face with cold water which refreshed and strengthened me. In the front
courtyard the birds were singing and the fountain was playing. I threw the
window open; the air was sweet and fresh, and I was grateful for the relief it
afforded me.</p>

<p>My wife continued to groan and toss about, and still I did not go to her. At
length she called my name in a fretful voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; I said, standing by the bedside.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you not come to me before?&quot; she asked, querulously. &quot;Did you not
hear me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I heard you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you kept away! How could you, love, how could you, when I am suffering
so?&quot; She paused for a sympathetic word from me, which she did not receive. &quot;I am
so ill, dear John, so very, very ill! My head is on fire. Give me your hand.&quot;</p>

<p>I made no responsive movement, and she looked at me from beneath her
half-closed lids.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not looking well yourself, John. Have you had a bad night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A most horrible night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am so sorry, dear. Watching by my side for so many hours has tired you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not been watching by your side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You bad boy—what could you have been doing; and why do you speak to me so
unfeelingly? I am sure I have done nothing to deserve it. Oh, my poor head! You
did not know I was accustomed to these headaches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I did not know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ought to have told you, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you ought to have told me. It would have been better for both of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t see that; unless you have deceived me, it could have made no
difference in your feelings, and I believed every word you said—yes, I did,
John, dear.&quot; She shuddered and moaned, as though seized with an ague. &quot;Get me
something, or I shall go mad with pain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What will you have? A cup of tea?&quot;</p>

<p>An expression of disgust spread over her features. &quot;Tea! It is the worst
thing I could take. You do not understand—of course you do not understand. Put
your arm round me, dear; let me lean my head on your shoulder; it will relieve
me.&quot; I did not stir. &quot;What do you mean by treating me so cruelly? I am your
wife, and you promised to love and cherish me. Have you forgotten so soon, so
soon?&quot; I did not reply, and her voice grew more imploring. &quot;When women suffer as
I do, John, they need something to keep up their strength. Oh, this frightful
sinking! I am sure a little brandy would do me good. Don&#39;t be shocked; I
wouldn&#39;t ask for it if I wasn&#39;t certain it would remove this horrible pain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Otherwise,&quot; I said, with sad and bitter emphasis, &quot;you would not touch it,
you have such abhorrence of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, of course I have. I take it only as a medicine.&quot; I picked up the empty
brandy bottle, and placed it on the dressing table. &quot;Oh, that,&quot; she exclaimed.
&quot;It was filled with lemonade, and I drank it every drop while you were away last
night. What kept you so long? Oh, my head is racked! I hope no pretty
Frenchwoman——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be silent!&quot; I cried, sternly. &quot;Of what use is this subterfuge? You cannot
deceive me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never tried to r I would not be so wicked. It is cruel of you to pick a
quarrel with me the moment we are married. People wouldn&#39;t believe it if they
were told. For God&#39;s sake, get me a little brandy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From me, Barbara, not one drop!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won&#39;t?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I will not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brute! Leave my room!&quot;</p>

<p>I was glad to obey her, feeling how idle it was to pursue the conversation.
The moment I was gone I heard her scramble from the bed and lock the door. Then
I heard the sound of things being violently tossed about, and presently the door
was unlocked, and she stood before me with a flaming face.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a thief!&quot; she screamed. &quot;You are a sneak and a spy——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, Barbara! The people in the hotel will hear you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let them hear! What do I care? You are my husband, and you are a thief. How
dare you rob me? How dare you sneak, and pry, and search my boxes, while I am
asleep? You&#39;ll be picking my pocket, next, I suppose. But I&#39;ll show you that a
married woman has rights. You men can&#39;t grind poor weak women into the dust any
longer. I&#39;ll show you!&quot; She rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>&quot;The servants must not see you in that state, Barbara,&quot; I said, with my back
against the door.</p>

<p>&quot;They shall see me in any state I please, and I will let them know—I will let
all the world know—that we have been married hardly a day, and that this is the
way you are treating me. I give you fair warning. If you don&#39;t get me the brandy
I will scream the house down!&quot;</p>

<p>What could I do? A waiter rapped at the door, and asked what monsieur
required. I gave him the order, and when the brandy was brought I took it from
him without allowing him to enter. Before I had time to turn round Barbara
snatched the decanter from my hand, and ran with it into the bedroom. In a few
minutes she returned, looking, to my astonishment, bright and well.</p>

<p>&quot;See what good it has done me,&quot; she said, in a blithe tone. &quot;When I am
suffering nothing has such an effect upon me as a small glass of brandy. It
pulls me together in a moment almost. The doctor ordered it especially for me,
and when I can&#39;t get it at once I feel as if I should go mad. I don&#39;t know what
I say or do, so I am not accountable, you know. Ask the doctor. I&#39;ll let you
into my secret, my dear.&#39; All women take it, from the highest to the lowest.
Fact, upon my word. You are a goose. Now, we will not quarrel any more, will we?
Kiss me, and make it up.&quot;</p>

<p>I kissed her to keep her quiet, and, indeed, I felt that I was helpless in
the hands of this brazen and cunning woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara,&quot; I said, &quot;you have caused me the greatest grief I have ever
experienced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am so sorry, so very, very sorry!&quot; she murmured. &quot;Can I say more than
that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can, Barbara. You can promise me never to drink spirits again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think I ever intend to?&quot; she asked, in a tone of astonishment.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now listen to me, love,&quot; she said, with an ingenuous smile. &quot;I will never
touch another drop as long as I live.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean that truly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly, truly, truly! I was so ill, and so unhappy at being left alone! I
can&#39;t bear you out of my sight, John, dear, and if you won&#39;t take advantage of
it I don&#39;t mind confessing I am a wee bit jealous. We will not talk of it any
more, will we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a solemn promise you have given me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A solemn, solemn promise, love. If you have any doubts of me I will go down
on my knees and swear it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I take your word, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>While Barbara was dressing the manager of the hotel waited upon me, and to my
surprise handed me my account. As I had not been in the house twenty-four hours
I inquired if it was usual for his visitors to pay from day to day. No, he
replied blandly it was not usual. Then why call upon me so soon for payment? Did
he mistrust me? He was shocked at the suggestion. Mistrust an English gentleman?
Certainly not—no, no. This with perfect politeness and much deprecatory waving
of his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;But you expect a settlement of this account,&quot; I said, irritated by his
manner.</p>

<p>&quot;If monsieur pleases. And if monsieur will be so obliging as to seek another
hotel in which he will be more comfortable, more at his ease——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; I said. &quot;You turn me out. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If monsieur will be pleased to listen. The servants were not used to the
ways of monsieur and madame; and there had been complaints from visitors. The
sick gentleman in the next apartment——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; I said, impatiently. &quot;I leave your hotel within the hour, and I
will never set foot in it again.&quot;</p>

<p>He was grieved, devastated, but if monsieur had so resolved——</p>

<p>These uncompleted sentences were very significant, and afforded a
sufficiently clear explanation of the proceeding. With suppressed anger I ran my
eye down the account, and pointed to an item of five francs for brandy.</p>

<p>&quot;Supplied this morning,&quot; he explained, &quot;to monsieur&#39;s order. Five francs—yes,
monsieur would find it quite correct.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I required only a small glass,&quot; I said. &quot;It is an imposition.&quot;</p>

<p>He trusted not; such an accusation had never been brought against him. Would
monsieur be kind enough to produce the decanter? A proper deduction would be
made if only one small glass had been taken.</p>

<p>&quot;Produce the decanter! Certainly I will.&quot;</p>

<p>I called to Barbara to give me the decanter, and, her white arm bared to the
shoulder, she handed it out to me. It was empty. I blushed from shame.</p>

<p>&quot;Does monsieur find the account correct?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is correct. Here is your money.&quot;</p>

<p>He receipted the bill and departed with polite bows and more deprecatory
waving of his hands. As I sat with my closed eyes covered by my hand, Barbara
touched my shoulder. I looked up into her smiling face.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I made myself beautiful, dear?&quot;</p>

<p>Most assuredly she would have been so in other men&#39;s eyes, for she was
eminently attractive, but she was not in mine. Her beautiful outside served only
to accentuate what was corrupt within.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you not answer? Are you not proud of your wife?&quot;</p>

<p>Proud of her? Great God! Proud of a woman who had brought this shame upon me,
and who, but an hour ago, was as degraded a spectacle as imagination could
compass.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t get sulky again,&quot; she said, and as I still did not speak, she asked
vehemently, &quot;What is the matter now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Simply that we are turned out of the hotel,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that all? The insolent ruffians! It is a thousand pities we ever came
here. But why get sulky over it? Paris is crammed with hotels, and they will
only be too glad to take our money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not that, Barbara. I wish to know if you drank all the brandy in the
decanter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All? It wasn&#39;t more than a thimbleful. And see what good it did me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you finish it before you promised never to touch spirits again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a tragedy voice, and what a tragedy face! Of course I did. Do you think
I would be so dishonorable as to break a promise I gave you—you, of all, men?
That isn&#39;t showing much confidence in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will keep that promise faithfully, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should be ashamed to look you in the face if I did not mean to keep it
faithfully. You will never find me doing anything underhanded or behind your
back, John.&quot;</p>

<p>I rallied at this. My happiness was lost, but there was a hope that our shame
would not be revealed to the world. As for what had occurred in this hotel, once
we were gone it would soon be forgotten. The swiftly turning kaleidoscope of
life in Paris is too absorbing in its changes to allow the inhabitants to dwell
long upon one picture, especially on a picture the principle figures in which
were persons so insignificant as ourselves.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a sou,&quot; cried Barbara, snapping her fingers in the faces of the servants
who swarmed about us when we were seated in the carriage; &quot;not one sou, you
greedy beggars!&quot; We drove out of the courtyard, and Barbara, turning to me, said
in her sweetest tone, &quot;I hope you will be very good to me, John, for you see how
weak I am. Oh, what I have gone through since you put the wedding ring on my
finger! The dear wedding ring!&quot; She put it to her lips and then to mine. &quot;I do
nothing but kiss it when I am alone. It means so much to both of us—love,
faithfulness, truth, trust in one another. All our troubles are over now, are
they not, love? And we are really commencing our honeymoon.&quot;</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession7" href="#ch07">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">There was no difficulty in obtaining accommodation at another
hotel. The choice rested with me, for I was not particular as to terms, I had no
scruple in spending part of my capital, my intentions having always been to
adopt a profession, and not to pass my days in idleness. My inclination was for
literature; I was vain enough to believe that I had in me the makings of a
novelist, and I had already in manuscript the skeleton of a work of fiction upon
which I intended to set to work when I was settled down in life. Before our
marriage I had confided my ambitious schemes to Barbara.</p>

<p>&quot;Delightful!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;My husband will be a famous author. What a
proud woman I shall be when I hear people praise his books!&quot;</p>

<p>I brought away from the hotel letters which had arrived for me, and Barbara
carried the bouquet I had purchased for her on the previous night. The moment we
were in our new quarters she called for a vase, and placed the flowers in water.
The brooch I had purchased at the same time was still in my pocket; the device
of two hearts entwined was a mockery now in its application to Barbara and
myself.</p>

<p>&quot;How sweet of you to buy these flowers,&quot; she said, with tender glances at me.
&quot;You will always love me, will you not—you will always buy flowers for me? I
have heard people say that marriage acts upon love like cold water on fire—puts
it out, but I should die with grief if I thought that would be so with us. What
are your letters about, dear?&quot;</p>

<p>They were from agents, giving me particulars of two houses, either of which
would be a suitable residence for us when we returned to London, and set up
housekeeping. Barbara and I had made many pleasant journeys in search of a
house, and we had selected two in the neighborhood of West Kensington. One was
unfurnished, the other had been the residence for a few months of a gentleman
who had furnished it in good style, and was desirous of selling the furniture
and his interest in the lease. I preferred the former, Barbara the latter, and I
now gave her the letters to read. The furnished house was offered to me for a
sum which I considered moderate, and an answer had to be given immediately, as
another likely purchaser was making inquiries about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Now sit down, like a good boy,&quot; said Barbara, &quot;and send the agent a cheque,
and settle it at once. It will be the dearest little home, and we shall be as
happy as the day is long.&quot;</p>

<p>I had no heart to argue the matter; after the experiences of the last
twenty-four hours one house was as good to me as another. A home we must have,
and I earnestly desired to avoid contention, so for the sake of peace I did as
Barbara wished, and wrote to the agent to close the bargain. While I was
attending to my correspondence Barbara was bustling about and chatting with a
chambermaid with whom she appeared to be already on confidential terms.</p>

<p>&quot;What delightful rooms these are,&quot; she said, looking over my shoulder as I
was writing, &quot;and what a clever business man my dear boy is! I am ever so glad
we moved from that disagreeable hotel. You must consult me in these things for
the future; I have an instinct which always guides me right. The moment I
entered the place I knew we should not be comfortable there. Go on with your
letters while Annette assists me to unpack. You must not look on, sir; I shall
not let you into the secrets of a lady&#39;s wardrobe till we have been married a
year at least. When you have finished your letters you can arrange your private
treasures while I am arranging mine, or if you are too tired you can lie on the
sofa and smoke a cigar. Would it shock you very much if I smoked a cigarette? It
is quite the fashionable thing for ladies to do.&quot;</p>

<p>I replied that I did not like to see women smoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you shall not see me do it,&quot; she said, vivaciously. &quot;I would die rather
than give you one moment&#39;s annoyance.&quot;</p>

<p>Annette was the chambermaid, a tall, thin-faced, spare woman of middle age;
and a stranger, observing her and my wife together, would have supposed they had
been long acquainted. Barbara was given to sudden and violent likings and
dislikings, and had once said to me, &quot;I love impulsive people. They are ever so
much better and so much more genuine than people who hum and ha, and want time
to consider whether they are fond of you or not. They resemble spiders who,
after watching for days and days, creep out of their corners when you least
expect it, and bind you tight so that you can&#39;t move, and say, &#39;I have made up
my mind; I am going to eat you bit by bit.&#39;&quot; I thought this speech very clever
when I first heard it, and I became immediately a worshiper of impulsiveness.
That Barbara should strike up a sudden friendship with the new chambermaid did
not, therefore, surprise me. Together they proceeded with the unpacking of
Barbara&#39;s wardrobe, Barbara darting in upon me now and then to give me a kiss,
&quot;on the sly,&quot; she whispered, &quot;for she mustn&#39;t see.&quot; Then she would return to
Annette, and they would laugh and talk. My letters written, I lit a cigar and
took up a French newspaper. Once Barbara brought a peculiar flavor into the
room, and I asked her what it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Cloves,&quot; she replied. &quot;I dote on them.&quot; She popped one into my mouth, and
said, &quot;Now we are equal and you can&#39;t complain. Oh, John, promise me never,
never to eat onions alone. I am passionately fond of them. You are beginning to
find out all my little failings.&quot;</p>

<p>She ran into the bedroom to tell Annette the joke, and there was much
giggling between them.</p>

<p>&quot;How provoking!&quot; she cried, darting in for the twentieth time. &quot;I have
mislaid the key of my small trunk. Lend me your keys; perhaps one of them will
fit.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave her my bunch of keys, and she was a long time trying them. I took no
notice of this, being engrossed in a feuilleton, and taking from the style in
which the exciting incidents were described a lesson for the novel I
contemplated writing.</p>

<p>&quot;Not one of them will fit,&quot; said Barbara, throwing the keys into my lap.
Shortly afterwards she called out, &quot;Congratulate me, John, I have found my key.
It was in my pocket all the time. See what a simple little woman you have
married; and you thought me clever, you foolish boy!&quot;</p>

<p>So far as I can recall my impressions I am endeavoring to describe them
faithfully. I went through many transitions of feeling in those days, now
hoping, now despairing, now accusing myself of doing my wife an injustice, now
sternly convinced that I was right. On this day I was comforted, Barbara was so
bright, so ingenuous, and I firmly believed she would keep the promise she had
given me. She brought into play all the arts and fascinations by which she had
beguiled me in our courting days. She ordered me to take her for a drive, to buy
her violets, to drive to the Magazin de Louvre to make purchases (where she
selected a number of things she did not need), to take her to a famous
restaurant to dine—&quot;it is so dull,&quot; she said, &quot;to dine in a stuffy little room
all by ourselves&quot;—and, dinner over, she invited me to accompany her to a theatre
where a comedy was being played which Annette had told her was very amusing.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t live without excitement,&quot; she said. &quot;I love theatres, I love bright
weather, I love flowers, I love handsome men—why do you look so grave, sir? Do
you not love handsome women? You are a ninny if you don&#39;t, and if you don&#39;t,
sir, why did you marry me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara,&quot; I said gravely, &quot;it is a strange question, I know, but do you
think we are suited to one another?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a strange question,&quot; she replied, laughing. &quot;My dear, we were made for
one another. Fie, love! Do you forget that marriages are made in Heaven?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ours, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, ours.&quot;</p>

<p>Wonderful were the inconsistencies of her utterances; one moment questioning
whether she had not made a mistake in marrying me, the next declaring that our
marriage was made in heaven.</p>

<p>&quot;I have not a secret from you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor I from you,&quot; she returned. &quot;I hope you agree with me, John, that there
should be perfect confidence between man and wife, that they should hide nothing
from one another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do agree with you; not even the smallest matter should be hidden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, John, love, not even the smallest matter. Little things are often very
important, and it is so awkward to be found out. I am so glad we are of one mind
about this. When we first engaged I said to Maxwell, &#39;John shall know everything
about me—everything. All my faults and failings—nothing shall be hidden from
him. Then he can&#39;t reproach me afterwards. I will be perfectly frank with him.&#39;
Maxwell called me a fool, and said there were lots of things people ought to
keep to themselves, and that I should be horrified if I were told all the
dreadful things you had done. He spoke of wild oats, and bachelors living alone,
and the late suppers they had in their chambers with girls and all sorts of
queer company. But I was determined. You might deceive me, but I would not
deceive you. I would not have that upon my conscience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You really kept nothing from me, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are keeping nothing from me now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, love.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not press her farther. Her smiling eyes looked into mine, and I had
received incontestible proof that she was lying to my face.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession8" href="#ch08">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">I was an inveterate smoker, and at this period my favorite habit
was a consolation to me. I smoked at all hours of the day, and Barbara had
encouraged me, saying that she loved the smell of a cigar. But on the morning
following the conversation I have just recorded she complained that my cigar
made her ill, and I went into the boulevard to smoke it. When I had thrown away
the stump I returned to the hotel to attend to my trunks, which were not yet
unpacked. These trunks were in a small ante-room, the key of which I had put in
my pocket. I had adopted this precaution in order that they should not be in
Barbara&#39;s sight, that she should not be left alone with them, and that when I
unpacked them she should not see what they contained. Upon my return to the
hotel Barbara was in her bed-room, attending to her toilet, and Annette was with
her. It was Barbara&#39;s first visit to Paris, and we had arranged to make the
round of its principal attractions.</p>

<p>The first trunk I opened was that in which I had deposited the five bottles
of brandy I had found among Barbara&#39;s dresses. To my astonishment they were
gone.</p>

<p>I was positive I had placed them there, but to make sure I searched my second
trunk, with the same result. The bottles had been abstracted. By whom, and by
what means?</p>

<p>The cunning hand was Barbara&#39;s.</p>

<p>What kind of a woman was I wedded to who spoke so fair and acted so
treacherously, who could smile in my face with secret designs in her heart
against my peace and happiness? I could go even farther than that, and say
against my honor. Fearful lest my indignation might cause me to lose control
over myself and lead to a scandalous scene, I locked the trunk and left the
hotel. In the open air I could more calmly review the deplorable position into
which I had been betrayed.</p>

<p>It is the correct word to use. Treacherously, basely, had I been betrayed.</p>

<p>It was long before I was sufficiently composed to apply myself to the
consideration of the plan by means of which Barbara obtained the bottles of
brandy. The lock of the trunk had not been tampered with, and no force had been
used in opening it. She must have had a duplicate key. How did she become
possessed of it?</p>

<p>I examined my keys, and I fancied I discerned traces of wax upon them. I
inquired my way to the nearest locksmith, and giving him the bunch asked whether
an impression in wax had been taken of any of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Of a certainty, monsieur,&quot; he said, &quot;else I could not have made them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is you, then, who made the duplicates?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Assuredly, it is I, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of how many?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of two, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of these two?&quot; indicating the keys of my two trunks.</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From impressions in wax which you received.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, monsieur,&quot; he said, redundantly affirmative. &quot;Have you come to ask
for them? But they were delivered and paid for last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By a thin-faced, middle-aged woman, with gray eyes and a white face?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The description is perfect. I trust the keys are to your satisfaction, and
that they fit the locks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They fit admirably,&quot; I said, and I gave him good morning.</p>

<p>Annette! She was in my wife&#39;s pay; together they had conspired against me.
The first practical step towards obtaining access to my boxes was taken when
Barbara informed me that she had mislaid one of her keys, and borrowed my bunch;
then the impressions in wax, and Annette going to the locksmith to give the
order; then the packet containing the keys which Annette had secretly conveyed
to my wife while my back was turned; then Barbara&#39;s complaint this morning that
my cigar made her ill, and my going out to smoke. During my absence my trunk was
opened and rifled. The petty little mystery was solved.</p>

<p>It was late when I returned to the hotel. I expected a stormy scene, it being
now two hours after the time I had appointed to take Barbara to see the sights
of Paris; but she was not in our rooms to reproach me. In the bedroom I noticed
that two padlocks had been newly fixed to each of her trunks. I went into the
office to make inquiries.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is out,&quot; said the manager.</p>

<p>&quot;On foot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, monsieur; in the carriage that was ordered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she go alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, monsieur; Annette accompanied her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Annette!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Has she not her duties to attend to here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is no longer in our service,&quot; was the reply. &quot;She is engaged by madame.
It was sudden, but she begged to be allowed to leave. Your wife implored also,
monsieur, and as another woman who had been with us before as chambermaid was
ready to take her place, we consented—to oblige madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Annette a good servant?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An excellent domestic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trustworthy, honest, and sober?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfectly. Madame could not desire a better.&quot;</p>

<p>Every word he spoke was in Annette&#39;s favor, and I felt that another burden
was on my life. If I could not cope with Barbara alone, how much less able was I
to cope with her now that she had such an ally as this sly creature?</p>

<p>At five o&#39;clock they came in together, my wife flushed and elated, Annette
quiet and placid as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;I have had a lovely day,&quot; said Barbara, as Annette assisted her to disrobe.
&quot;I suppose my dear boy has been running all over the city in search of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mistaken,&quot; I replied. &quot;I have not searched for you at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not going to believe everything you say, you bad boy,&quot; she said,
darting into the bedroom.</p>

<p>I divined the reason; it was to ascertain whether the padlocks on her boxes
had been tampered with. Reassured on this point, she resumed her chatter.</p>

<p>&quot;How lonely my dear boy must have been! I declare he has been smoking.
Annette, give me my cloves. Will you have one, John? No? Is it not good of
Annette to accept the situation I offered her? She will travel with us to
Switzerland and Italy, and will tell us all we want to know about the hotels
there, and what is worth seeing, and what not. She will save you no end of
money. And what a perfect lady&#39;s maid she is! I wonder what possessed me to
leave England without one; but I am glad now that I did not engage one there,
for I could not have got anybody half so handy and clever as Annette.&quot;</p>

<p>While my wife was speaking Annette made no sign, and nothing in her manner
indicated that she understood what was being said in her praise. Had she been a
stone image she could not have shown less interest. This was carrying acting too
far, for her name being frequently mentioned, she would naturally have exhibited
some curiosity.</p>

<p>&quot;And only thirty-five pounds a year,&quot; my wife continued, and would have
continued her prattle had I not interrupted her.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to speak to you alone, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are alone, you dear boy.&quot; I looked towards the imperturbable woman she
had engaged. &quot;Oh, do you object to Annette? What difference can she make? She
understands no language but her own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should prefer to be alone with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To say disagreeable things, I suppose, when there are no witnesses present.
Oh, I know you. She shall not go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it right to oppose me in such a small matter? Surely we ought
to keep our quarrels to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is quarreling?&quot; she retorted. &quot;I am not. And as to what is right and
wrong, I am as good a judge as you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Annette,&quot; said I, addressing the woman in French, &quot;leave the room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oui, monsieur,&quot; she replied, with perfect submissiveness, and was about to
go when my wife said:</p>

<p>&quot;Annette, remain here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oui, madame,&quot; she replied, without any indication of surprise at these
contradictory orders. To outward appearance she was an absolutely passive agent,
ready at a word to go hither or thither, to say yea or nay, without the least
feeling or interest in the matter; but any one who judged her by this standard
would have found himself grievously at fault.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; I said. &quot;I will postpone speaking of a very serious subject till
I can do so out of the hearing of strangers. I will only say now that you should
not have engaged this woman without consulting me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, I shall not consult you,&quot; returned Barbara, &quot;upon my domestic
arrangements, and I am astonished at your interference. It is I who have to
attend to them, and I will not be thwarted and ordered to do this or that. You
think a wife is a slave; I will show you that she is not.&quot; She paused a moment,
and then shrugged her shoulders. &quot;What you have to say had best be said at once,
perhaps. In heaven&#39;s name let us get it over.&quot; She stepped to Annette&#39;s side,
and whispered a word or two in her ear; the next moment we were alone. &quot;Now,
John, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With the connivance of that woman you have had false keys made, with which,
in my absence—artfully contrived by yourself—you have opened my trunks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You admit it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit nothing. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With those false keys you ransacked my trunks, and stole certain articles
from them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stole?&quot; she cried with a scornful laugh. &quot;A proper word for you to use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind the word——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I shall mind the word. You will be dictating to me next how I shall
express myself. If there is a thief here, it is you. I call you thief to your
face. You ought to feel flattered that I followed your example, but nothing
seems to please you. And you should consider, my dear—what is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander. You opened my trunks on the sly; I opened yours
on the sly, and took possession of my property which you had stolen from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit,&quot; I said, speaking without passion, &quot;that I was wrong——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, indeed! And that admission justifies you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The end justified me; what I found justified me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In your opinion, because you can do no wrong. Seriously, my love, do you
look upon me as a child, and do you think I will allow myself to be spied upon
and robbed with impunity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What I did was for your good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Allow me, if you please, to be the judge of what is good for me. Will it
offend you to hear me say that no gentleman would act as you have done?&quot;</p>

<p>It would have been wiser, perhaps, had I refrained from uttering the retort
that rose to my lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Would any lady act as you have acted?&quot;</p>

<p>But who can control himself when he is brought face to face with an
overwhelming and undeserved misfortune.</p>

<p>&quot;Best leave ladies and gentlemen out of the question,&quot; she said, mockingly.
&quot;As you pay me the compliment of declaring that I am not a lady, pay me the
further compliment of designating what I am.&quot;</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;I will give you a little lesson in frankness, my dear. When I married you I
believed I was marrying a man of honor, unfortunately I was mistaken. It has not
taken me long to discover that my husband is a common spy—attached to the
detective office, probably, the sort of man who listens at keyholes and searches
his wife&#39;s pockets when she is asleep. Don&#39;t forget, love, that it was you who
commenced it. If I were a milksop I should sit down and weep, as some poor
creatures do, but I am not a milksop; I can protect myself. Therefore, John. I
am not going to make myself unhappy; I am much too sensible. I am not an old
woman yet, and I intend to enjoy my life. And now, my dear,&quot; she added, after a
moment&#39;s pause, &quot;I am waiting for your next insult.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid it is useless to argue with you,&quot; I said, sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;Upon this subject, quite useless,&quot; she replied. &quot;Upon any other I am your
humble servant. Have you finished, then? Thank you. Annette!&quot;</p>

<p>The woman came in so promptly as to convince me that she had been listening
in the passage.</p>

<p>&quot;She waited outside by my orders,&quot; said my wife, laughing.</p>

<p>I left them together.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession9" href="#ch09">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">When I had left Barbara and Annette together, I took myself
seriously to task. I asked myself whether I understood Barbara&#39;s character, and
the answer seemed clear. I had not studied it; I did not understand it. She was
a beautiful creature with whom I had fallen in love; it was surface love, and I
had made no attempt to probe the inner life. In this respect I was no worse off
than multitudes of men and women who marry without knowing each other. Was
Barbara to blame for it? No. She was in a state of dependence upon a brother
whose character I detested. I had offered myself and was accepted. For the fate
in store for me I, and I alone, was to blame.</p>

<p>I would be lenient towards her; I would devise some wise plan by which she
could be wooed from the wrong path. After all, she was, perhaps, to be pitied.
Thus did I argue, thus did I manufacture excuses for her, thus did I school
myself into a calmer frame of mind.</p>

<p>In this better mood I met her when Annette was not with her, and asked where
she would dine.</p>

<p>&quot;Where you please,&quot; she answered, meekly.</p>

<p>Her softened tone filled me with pity and remorse.</p>

<p>&quot;My wish is to please you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>She glanced at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you setting a trap for me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Barbara, only I have been thinking that we do not quite understand one
another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems so,&quot; she admitted, in a mournful voice, &quot;and it is making me very
unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, don&#39;t let it make you unhappy any longer. We both have faults, and we
will try to correct them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You dear boy!&quot; she cried, throwing her arms round my neck. &quot;Then you confess
you were in the wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I confess it, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I confess that I was in the wrong. Now, we are equal.&quot;</p>

<p>After a pause:</p>

<p>&quot;No one is quite perfect, John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not within human limits, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We agree—we agree!&quot; she danced about the room in delight. &quot;Isn&#39;t it
delightful? Oh, I was beginning to despair!&quot;</p>

<p>There was really something childlike in her voice and manner, and I followed
her movements with admiration. Suddenly she stopped, and throwing herself on the
sofa, hid her face in the cushion, and began to sob.</p>

<p>It was the first time that an act of mine had caused a woman to sob, and it
unmanned me. I sat by her side and soothed her with awkward, endearing words,
and my efforts were rewarded; she became calmer.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so sweet, so sweet, when you are like this!&quot; she murmured, and dried
her eyes. &quot;You are my dear old boy again, just as you were before we were
married. Oh, John, why did you go over my boxes on the sly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was wrong; I have confessed it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I like to hear you say it. You were wrong!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I was wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean it, dear—you are not deceiving me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Barbara, I am not deceiving you.&quot;</p>

<p>She pouted. &quot;It is nothing but &#39;Barbara, Barbara.&#39; &#39;Yes, Barbara,&#39; &#39;No,
Barbara.&#39; Not so very long ago you would say, &#39;No, my love,&#39; &#39;Yes, my darling.&#39;
Now, my dear, dear boy, say out of your very heart, &#39;I am not deceiving you, my
darling.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>I repeated the words; to have refused, to have hesitated, would have
destroyed the good work, the better understanding, of which I seemed to see the
promise.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not deceiving you, my darling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how good it is to hear you speak like that! It is like waking out of a
horrid dream to a delightful reality. And you truly, truly love me?&quot;</p>

<p>Again I answered, under pressure. &quot;I truly love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I don&#39;t care for anything else in the wide, wide world, and I am the
happiest woman in it. You had almost forgotten, had you not, John, that I was
alone in this city, without a friend but you? I have only you—only you. I hardly
cared to live, for what is life without love? But I was frightening myself
unnecessarily—or were you doing it just to try me. You will be kind to me, will
you not, dear?&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, I have no other desire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See how a foolish woman can create shadows that terrify her. That is what I
did; but they are gone now, all blown away by my dear boy&#39;s tender words. And
you don&#39;t mind my little faults—you will put up with them.&quot;</p>

<p>I ventured a saving clause. &quot;Yes, Barbara, and I will try to correct them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you will; I expect you to. But you must do it in a nice way. Long
lectures are horrid. When I try to correct yours—for that will be only fair
play, John, will it, not?—you will see how gentle I will be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the same time, Barbara, while we are correcting each other&#39;s faults, we
must help ourselves by trying to correct our own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I promise, with all my heart; and when I make a promise in that way you may
be perfectly sure that it will be performed. That is a virtue I really possess.
And so we will go on correcting each other till we are old, old people, ready to
become angels, when we sha&#39;n&#39;t have any faults at all to correct. For angels are
faultless, you know. I am deeply religious, John, dear. There are angels and
devils. The good people become angels, the wicked people devils.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mixing up things, rather, are you not, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it is full of mystery, and who does know for certain? But one can
believe; there is no harm in that, is there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I believe there is a heaven and a hell. You believe it, too, of course?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Assuredly I believe there is a heaven, but not that there is a hell
hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p>She pondered over the words. &quot;A hell hereafter! Why the &#39;hereafter,&#39; dear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I have a firm conviction that we may suffer hell in this life, but
not in the next.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A hell in this life! That would be awful. We will not suffer it, love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I trust not, sincerely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Trust not!&#39; You mean you are sure we shall not, surely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure we shall not, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>I was as wax in her hands, standing, so to speak, forever on the edge of a
precipice of her creating, and compelled to the utterance of sentiments to which
I could not conscientiously subscribe, in order to escape the wreck of a
possible happiness.</p>

<p>&quot;That I believe in hell fire and you do not,&quot; she said, thoughtfully, &quot;shall
not be a cause of difference between us. Everybody thinks his own ideas of
religion are right. Perhaps bye and bye I will try to convert you, and if you
feel very strongly on the subject of hell you shall try to convert me. Which do
you think worse—a hell in this life, or a hell in the next?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never considered it. Don&#39;t let us worry ourselves about theological
matters during our honeymoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right, John; see how quickly I give in to you. I will tell you why,
sir—because it is a wife&#39;s duty. You will never find me behindhand in that. Our
honeymoon! How nicely you said it. There shall be nothing but sunshine and
flowers, and the singing of birds, and love. Oh, what a happy, happy time! And
you are no longer angry with me that I have engaged Annette?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not angry with you at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;John,&quot; she said, shaking her finger playfully at me, &quot;that is an evasion,
and you mustn&#39;t set me bad examples. Answer my question immediately, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Barbara, so long as she does not bring discord between us——&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped me with a kiss. &quot;No, John, that will not do—it really will not
do, you bad boy. You mustn&#39;t take unreasonable antipathies to people. A
lady&#39;s-maid has a great deal to put up with, and mistresses are often very
trying. There, you see, I don&#39;t spare myself—oh, no, I am a very just person,
and I like every one to be justly treated. Say at once, sir, that you are no
longer angry with me for engaging Annette.&quot;</p>

<p>Mistrusting the woman as I did, I was forced, for the sake of peace, to
express approval of her. Barbara clapped her hands, and declared we should be
quite a happy family.</p>

<p>It was after this interview that Barbara had a religious fit. Twice a day she
went to the Madeleine, and spent an hour there upon her knees. Sometimes Annette
accompanied her, sometimes I, upon her invitation. I asked her why she, a
Protestant, frequented a Catholic place of worship.</p>

<p>&quot;What does it matter, the place?&quot; she asked, in return, speaking in a gentle
tone. &quot;It does one good to pray. Even to kneel in such a temple without saying a
prayer strengthens one&#39;s soul. Through the solemn silence, broken now and then
by a sob from some poor woman&#39;s broken heart, a message comes from God. Women
are greatly to be pitied, John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Men, too, sometimes,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she answered, quickly, &quot;there is no comparison.&quot;</p>

<p>A trifling incident may be set down here, in connection with the brooch, with
its device of two hearts, which I had purchased as a present for Barbara on the
first night we were in Paris, and which I afterwards determined not to give her.
I was in the sitting-room clearing my pockets. Among the things I had taken out
was the brooch, which I had almost forgotten. I was still of the opinion that it
would be an unsuitable gift, and I was thinking what to do with it when Annette
passed through the sitting-room to the bedroom, her eyes, as usual, lowered to
the ground. In the course of the day I went to the jeweler of whom I had
purchased the brooch, and he took it back at half the price I had paid for it. I
thought no more of the matter.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession10" href="#ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">I had taken circular tickets for a two months&#39; ramble through
Switzerland and Italy, intending to visit Lucerne, Berne, Interlaken, Chamouni,
and Geneva, then on to the Italian lakes, and I was studying the plan I had
mapped out, and making notes of bye-excursions from the principal towns, when
Barbara burst in upon me with the exclamation that she was sick of Paris. This
surprised me. We had intended to remain for two weeks, only one of which had
elapsed, and I had supposed that the busy, brilliant life of the gay city would
be so much to Barbara&#39;s liking that I should have a difficulty in getting her
away from it. For my own part I was glad to leave, glad to travel sooner than we
intended to regions where we should be in closer contact with nature. Barbara
had never visited Switzerland or Italy, and I hoped that association with the
lakes and mountains of those beautiful countries would be beneficial to her,
would help her to shake off the fatal habit which she had allowed to grow upon
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, Barbara,&quot; I said, &quot;we will leave for Lucerne to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How long does it take to get to Geneva?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;From Lucerne?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, from here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a morning train, which gets there in the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we will go to-morrow morning to Geneva.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that will make a muddle of the route I have mapped out, and jumble up
the dates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does that matter? You can easily make out another; our time is our own.
I want to be in Geneva to-morrow night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For any particular reason?&quot; I asked, rather annoyed, for I knew how
difficult it was to divert her from anything upon which she had set her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;For a very particular reason. Maxwell will be there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he tell you so before we left England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; he tells me in a letter, and says how nice it will be for us to meet
there.&quot;</p>

<p>I thought otherwise. I had no wish to see Maxwell, but I did not say so.</p>

<p>&quot;When did you hear from him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His letter did not come to the hotel. They told me in the office that there
were none for us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t address me at the hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where then, for goodness sake? The hotel is the proper place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I don&#39;t care about always doing what is proper,&quot; she retorted,
lightly. &quot;Besides, do I need your permission to carry on a correspondence with
my brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all; you are putting a wrong construction upon my words.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, of course. I don&#39;t do anything right, do I? Never mind, you may make
yourself as unpleasant as you like, but you won&#39;t get me to join in a wrangle.
Do I pry into your letters? Well, then, don&#39;t pry into mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no desire to do so. Only, as I suppose this is not the first letter
you have received from Maxwell since we have been in Paris——&quot;</p>

<p>She interrupted me with &quot;I have had three letters from him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I thought you might have mentioned it—that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t wish to annoy you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should it annoy me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, John,&quot; she said, in a more conciliatory tone, &quot;haven&#39;t I eyes in my
head? Women, really, are not quite brainless. Do you think I didn&#39;t find out
long ago that there was no love lost between you and Maxwell? Not on his
side—oh, no; on yours.&quot;</p>

<p>I could have answered that, according to my observation of her, her feelings
towards Maxwell were similar to mine, but I was determined to avoid, as far as
was possible, anything in the shape of argument that might lead to contention.</p>

<p>&quot;I do hope you will get to like him better,&quot; she continued, &quot;and you will
when you understand him. That is what we were talking about a few days ago,
isn&#39;t it?—about the advisability of people understanding each other before they
pronounce judgment. If they don&#39;t they are so apt to do each other an injustice.
Maxwell is as simple as a child; the worst of it is, he takes a delight in
placing himself at a disadvantage when he is talking to you, saying the wrong
thing, you know, but never meaning the least harm by it—oh, no. He leaves you to
find it out—so boyish, isn&#39;t it? He is inconsistent; it is a serious fault, but
it is a serious misfortune, too, when one can&#39;t help it. It is a shame to blame
us for our imperfections; we didn&#39;t make them; they are born with us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Barbara,&quot; I said, a feeling of bewildered helplessness stealing over me
at the contradictions to which she was everlastingly giving utterance, &quot;we are
reasonable beings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, to a certain extent, but no farther. The question is to what
extent. Take the son of a thief, now; how can he help being a thief? He was born
one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t punish him for stealing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think I would, for how can he help it? I would teach him—I would
lead him gently.&quot;</p>

<p>I brightened up. &quot;That is what we are trying to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; for it is so wrong to take what doesn&#39;t belong to us—and to take it on
the sly, too! To go over boxes when one is ill and unconscious. Fie, John! I
hoped we were not going to speak of that again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it is you who brought it up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, love, it was you. You shouldn&#39;t allow things to rankle in your mind;
it is hardly manly. What was I saying about Maxwell? Oh, his inconsistency. I am
glad I am not inconsistent, but I am not going to boast of it. Only you might
take a lesson from me. The weak sometimes can help the strong. Remember the
fable of the lion and the mouse.&quot;</p>

<p>I changed the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;We will start for Geneva to-morrow morning. It is a delightful journey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything is delightful in your company, you dear boy. You are glad that we
shall soon see Maxwell, are you not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am glad if it will give you pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, dear. Could any newly-married couple be happier than we are? Give
me a kiss and I will go and do my packing.&quot;</p>

<p>I recall these conversations with amazement. I was as a man who was groping
in the dark, vainly striving to thread his way through the labyrinths in which
he was environed. There was an element of masterly cunning in Barbara&#39;s
character by the exercise of which I found myself continually placed in a wrong
light; words I did not speak, motives I did not entertain, sentiments which were
foreign to my nature, were so skillfully foisted upon me, that, communing
afterwards with my thoughts, I asked myself whether I was not the author of them
and had forgotten that they had proceeded from me. But Barbara&#39;s own conflicting
utterances were a sufficient answer to these doubts. One day she informed me
that Maxwell had a contempt for me, the next that he had a high opinion of me.
Now she despised him, now she was longing for his society. One moment he was all
that was bad, the next all that was good.</p>

<p>I did not allow these contradictions to weigh with me. My aim was to do my
duty by my wife, and to save her from becoming a confirmed drunkard; to that end
all the power that was within me was directed.</p>

<p>In order not to put temptation in Barbara&#39;s way I became a teetotaler, and
from that day to this, except upon one occasion, have not touched liquor of any
kind.</p>

<p>&quot;No wine, John?&quot; Barbara said, as we were eating dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Barbara; I am better without it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Turned teetotaler?&quot; She looked at me with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About the most foolish thing you could do. Wine is good for a man.
Everything is good in moderation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree with you—in moderation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said in moderation—the word is mine, not yours. You will alter your mind
soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be common politeness to ask if I would have some.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied vehemently, &quot;you know I hate it.&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning we were comfortably seated in the train for Geneva. Annette
was knitting, I was looking through some English papers and magazines I had
obtained at Brentano&#39;s, and Barbara was reading a French novel she had purchased
at the railway stall. She appeared to be so deeply interested in it that I asked
her what it was. She handed it to me. I started as I looked at the title.
&quot;L&#39;Assoimmoir!&quot; I handed it back to her, thinking it strange she should have
selected the work, but drawing from it a happy augury, for there is no story in
which the revolting effects of drink are portrayed with greater coarseness and
power. It did not occur to me that I should have been sorry to see such a work
in the hands of a pure-minded woman, and that the absence of the reflection was
a wrong done to a woman who was but newly married—and that woman my own wife! My
thought was: What effect will the story have upon Barbara? Will it show her in
an impressive and personal way the awful depths of degradation to which drink
can bring its victims, and will it be a warning to her?</p>

<p>&quot;Have you read it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered. &quot;It is a terrible story; it teaches a terrible lesson.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard so,&quot; she said, &quot;and I was quite anxious to read it myself. It
opens brightly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait till you come to the end,&quot; I thought.</p>

<p>She went on with the reading, and was so engrossed in the development of the
sordid, wretched tragedy that she paid but little attention to the scenery
through which we were passing. I did not interrupt her. &quot;Let it sink into her
soul,&quot; I thought. &quot;God grant that it may appall and terrify her!&quot;</p>

<p>In the afternoon the book was finished. But she was loth to lay it aside. She
read the last few pages, and referred to others which presumably had produced an
impression upon her. Then she put the book down. I looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>&quot;You are right,&quot; she said. &quot;It does indeed teach a terrible lesson.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not pursue the subject. If the effect I hoped for had not been produced
no words of mine would bring it about.</p>

<p>A fellow passenger engaged me in conversation, and we stood upon the landing
stage awhile. When I returned to the carriage I detected that Barbara had been
tippling; the signs were unmistakable. Later in the day she made reference to
the story and expressed sympathy for the victims of the awful vice.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that your only feeling respecting the story?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;What other feeling can I have?&quot; she replied, sorrowfully. &quot;It was born in
them. Poor Gervaise! Poor Coupeau! I don&#39;t know which I pity most.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the terrible lesson, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything in moderation,&quot; she said, and after a little pause, added,
&quot;Besides, it isn&#39;t true; it isn&#39;t possible. Novel writers are compelled to draw
upon their imaginations, and they invent unheard-of things—as you will do, I
suppose with your stories. Make them hot and strong, John, and you will stand a
greater chance of success. People like to have their blood curdled. If I had the
talent to write a novel I should stick at nothing. Look at——,&quot; she mentioned the
name of a living English author whose stories were wonderfully successful—&quot;he
deals in nothing but blood; in every novel he writes he kills hundreds and
hundreds of people, and slashes them up dreadfully. His pages absolutely reek
with gore. Now, you can&#39;t convince me that he is describing real life; he is
describing things that never occurred, that never could have occurred. It is
just the same with this story that I have been reading. Very clever, of course,
and very horrible, but absolutely untrue.&quot;</p>

<p>That was her verdict, and I knew it was useless to argue with her.</p>

<p>We arrived at Geneva between eight and nine o&#39;clock. In accordance with
Barbara&#39;s wish, we took the omnibus of the Hotel de la Paix, where Maxwell was
to meet us. She was disappointed that he was not at the station; we looked out
for him, but we did not see him.</p>

<p>It happened that the lady and gentleman of whom I have spoken took the same
omnibus and were seated when we entered. They drew into a corner of the omnibus,
and the gentleman shifted his place so that he sat between his companion and
Barbara. He seemed to be desirous that the ladies should not sit next to each
other.</p>

<p>A disappointment awaited Barbara at the hotel. Maxwell was not there. When I
gave my name to the proprietor and was speaking about the rooms we were to
occupy, he said, &quot;There is a letter for madame,&quot; and handed it to her. It was
from Maxwell. She read it with a frown.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a shame—a shame!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;What does he say?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;He will not be here till the end of the week,&quot; she replied, fretfully. &quot;He
may not be here at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not,&quot; she retorted, fiercely. &quot;You are glad.&quot;</p>

<p>And certainly it was she who spoke the truth.</p>

<p>We went up in the lift to look at our rooms, and then I came down again to
order dinner. Returning to inform Barbara that it would be ready in twenty
minutes, I found the door locked.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me alone,&quot; Barbara cried from within. &quot;I don&#39;t want any dinner. You can
have it without me. It won&#39;t spoil your appetite.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned to go downstairs and met Annette.</p>

<p>&quot;Is my wife unwell?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is disturbed that her brother has not arrived,&quot; the woman answered.
&quot;She does not require me any longer to-night. I am to get something to eat and
go to bed. Good-night, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-night, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p>She had spoken sulkily, as though vexed at not being allowed to wait upon her
mistress.</p>

<p>I had my dinner alone, and afterwards strolled along the banks of the
beautiful lake, smoking a cigar. There was no moon, but the sky was bright with
stars. I was in no hurry, knowing that when Barbara was in one of her passionate
fits it was best to give her plenty of time to get over it. My presence
irritated her, and I did not care to be the butt of her unreasonable anger.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession11" href="#ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">There was still no news of Maxwell, and I was pleased to be spared
his presence.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot say whether the scene which took place later in the day between
me and Barbara was inspired by a communication which she had just received from
Annette, or whether she had been already enlightened upon the subject, and had
stored up the pretended grievance for use against me when she was in the humor
for it. It matters little either way, and perhaps it would have been wiser of me
to treat the accusation with contempt; but there are limits to a man&#39;s patience,
and I could not always keep control of myself. It was commenced by Barbara
inquiring whether my lady friend had followed us to Geneva, and by her answering
the question herself.</p>

<p>&quot;But of course she has. You have laid your plans artfully. Keep her out of my
way, or I&#39;ll strangle her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mad,&quot; I muttered, and indeed, I must either have believed so, or
that she was at her devil&#39;s tricks again.</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; she screamed, and then I knew that she had been drinking. &quot;Not
yet. You may drive me to it in the end, but the end hasn&#39;t come yet. No, not by
many a long day, Johnnie, my dear! Only don&#39;t let me get hold of her, or
there&#39;ll be murder done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me what you mean,&quot; I said, closing the doors and windows, for I was
anxious that the people in the hotel should not hear, &quot;and I may be able to
answer you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the lady&#39;s brooch you bought in Paris?&quot; she asked. &quot;Show it to me,
and I&#39;ll be satisfied. Well, where is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Then I recollected that Annette had passed through the room of the hotel in
Paris when I emptied my pockets there; I was looking at the brooch, debating
what I should do with it.</p>

<p>&quot;You are thinking what to say,&quot; Barbara continued. &quot;I will save you the
trouble of inventing a lie. Say that you bought it for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be the truth. I did buy it for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give it me, then; it belongs to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot give it to you; I have parted with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it without your telling me. You gave it to the other woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no other woman in the case. Be reasonable, Barbara. Things are bad
enough, God knows, but I can honestly say you have no cause for jealousy. The
brooch was intended for you, but I changed my mind, and returned it to the
jeweler.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not thinking it suitable for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly. I did not think it suitable for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The device was not appropriate, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was not appropriate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder you are not ashamed to look me in the face. It was a device of two
hearts entwined—yours and another woman&#39;s—and it was not a suitable device to
offer to me, whom you had married but the day before!&quot; (I thought with dismay
that Annette must have sharp eyes to have seen it in that brief moment when she
passed me, looking slyly on the ground.) &quot;You are a clumsy liar, John. If you
want to know, it was because I was maddened by your shameful conduct that I left
you last night. I was sorry for it afterwards. I reasoned with myself, saying,
He is my husband, and it is my duty to be by his side. That is why I was not
sorry when you found me this morning. You may break my heart, but I will never
leave you again, never, never! Now that I have found you out don&#39;t presume to
lecture me again upon any little faults I may have—but keep your women out of my
sight, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>I argued no longer; my heart was filled with bitterness; the smallest of my
actions was turned against me with such ingenuity as to render me powerless.</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon the incidents that enlivened the remaining weeks of
this mockery of a honeymoon. Again and again did I find Barbara under the
influence of drink, and again and again did I seek refuge in silence, for every
word I spoke was twisted into an accusation against myself. We saw nothing of
Maxwell, and after a month&#39;s tour Barbara declared she was tired of foreign
countries and foreign people, and yearned to take her proper place in our dear
little home in London. &quot;Where you will discover,&quot; she said (she was in one of
her amiable moods), &quot;that I am a model wife, and a perfect treasure of a
housekeeper.&quot;</p>

<p>We were in London nearly two months before we settled in our new home, which,
as I have stated, was situated in West Kensington. Immediately upon our return
Barbara and I drove to the house, and took a tour of inspection through the
rooms. It seemed to me that a few days would suffice for the necessary
alterations and additions, but Barbara was of a different opinion. This piece of
furniture did not suit her, that would not do, the other was altogether out of
place. She did not like the paper on the walls, the ceilings were frightful, the
patterns of the carpets horrible. Before our marriage we had come to London to
see the house, and then she was satisfied with everything, now she is satisfied
with nothing. If I ventured to make a remonstrance her reply was:</p>

<p>&quot;Do let me manage! What can you know about domestic affairs? Leave them to
me; I will soon put things to rights.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing that her idea of putting things to rights would cost a large sum of
money, I said:</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, Barbara, I am not a millionaire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; she answered, &quot;but you have thousands and thousands of pounds,
you stingy fellow, and we must commence comfortably. Our whole happiness depends
upon it. I sha&#39;n&#39;t ruin you, my dear. Besides, are you not going to coin money
out of your books?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have to be written first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. And to write striking stories you must have a cosy study. Do you
think it is my comfort I am looking after? My dear old boy, you shall have the
snuggest den in London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When they are written—-if they ever are&quot;—I was tortured by a doubt whether
my mind would be sufficiently at ease for literary work—&quot;they may not find favor
with the publishers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will manage them, John. Don&#39;t meet troubles half way. There is a clever
song—did you ever hear it?—&#39;Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you.&#39;
That is what I call common sense.&quot;</p>

<p>The result was that she had her way. My one desire was for peace. Love held
no place in my heart The utmost I could hope for was that I should not be
plunged into disgrace.</p>

<p>I had very little to do with the new arrangements of the house. Finding that
every suggestion I made was received with opposition, I became wearied with the
whole affair, my share in which was limited to paying the bills. This exactly
suited Barbara, who now and then rewarded me by declaring that she was having a
delightful time. During these few weeks we lived in a furnished flat in
Bloomsbury, and having nothing else to do, I spent the greater part of the day
in the reading-room of the British Museum, for which I had held a ticket since I
left my stepmother&#39;s house. Barbara and I would breakfast together in the
morning, and make arrangements for a late dinner. Then we would separate;
Barbara for West Kensington, accompanied by Annette, I for the British Museum,
or for a lonely walk or ride. Once or twice a week, when the weather was fine, I
would ride on the top of an omnibus to its terminus, and return to my
starting-point by the same conveyance. My favorite ride was eastward, through
Whitechapel, and occasionally I would alight in the centre of that wonderful
thoroughfare—where a greater variety of the forms of human life can be met than
in any other part of the modern Babylon—and plunge into the labyrinth of narrow
streets and courts with which the district abounds. What made the deepest
impression upon me in my wanderings thereabouts was the poverty of the residents
and the immense number and the magnificence of the gin palaces, in the immediate
vicinity of the most flourishing of which were usually congregated groups of
wretched men, women and children—chiefly the latter during the midday hours of
my visits—whose one idea of life and life&#39;s duties was drink. The subject had a
fascination for me, and my heart sank as I noted the hideous degradation to
which it brings its victims. The soddened, bestial faces, the shameless
lasciviousness, the frightful language, the hags of forty who looked seventy,
the young children with preternatural cunning stamped on their features, and
from whose ready tongue familiar blasphemies proceeded; girl-mothers with
exposed breasts putting glasses of gin to their babies&#39; lips—these were horrible
and common sights. I was standing watching such a scene in a narrow, squalid
street, flanked at each corner by a gorgeous, shining palace of gin, when I
noticed a policeman at my side. We entered into conversation, and I learned that
he had placed himself near me as a protection.</p>

<p>&quot;A famous thieves&#39; quarter this, sir,&quot; he said; &quot;I thought you mightn&#39;t
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for the warning,&quot; I replied; &quot;the people are very poor; all the
houses seem to be tumbling down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They belong to a big swell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does he not come to inspect them?&quot;</p>

<p>The policeman—an intelligent man, evidently with some education—laughed. &quot;He
may have seen them once in his lifetime, and that was enough for him. The
property is managed by an agent, in the employ of the steward of the estate, who
walks through it perhaps once a year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The rents must be very low.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not low enough for them that live here. There isn&#39;t a house in the street
with less than three or four families in it.&quot;</p>

<p>I pointed to two girls whose ages could not have been more than fifteen or
sixteen, each with a baby at her breast, &quot;What becomes of them when they grow
old?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They never grow old,&quot; was his significant reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you a reporter for a newspaper, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I am here merely out of curiosity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t come at night—alone,&quot; he said, as he turned away.</p>

<p>His question had put an idea into my head which I thought might be carried
into effect for the benefit of that half of the world that does not know how the
other half lives.</p>

<p>I make no excuse for introducing this episode into my story; the sights I saw
had an indirect bearing upon my own life.</p>

<p>In the evening Barbara and I would meet in our Bloomsbury flat, and go out to
dinner, generally to a foreign restaurant, and sometimes afterwards to a theatre
or a music hall, the latter being always of Barbara&#39;s choosing. I followed in
her wake; the least resistance or reluctance to carry out her wishes only
brought fresh misery upon me. She continued to tipple, but not in my presence;
it seemed to be a principle of her life to do everything in secret. On Sundays
she went to church, and professed to be much edified by the discourse. She would
pray at home, too. Once when I entered our sitting-room I discovered her on her
knees before a couch, her face buried in the cushion. She remained there so long
that I put my hand on her shoulder. She did not move. Looking down I found she
was asleep, with a vacuous smile on her countenance. I moved to another part of
the room, and soon afterwards she staggered to her feet, and stood, reeling to
and fro. &quot;Annette!&quot; she called querulously. The woman entered, and supported her
to her bedroom. The next day she complained of her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;I was very ill yesterday,&quot; she said. &quot;I fainted while I was praying. My
prayers were for you, John.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not answer her, and she asked me whether I ever thought of the future
world.</p>

<p>&quot;It is our duty, my dear,&quot; she said. &quot;Life in this is very sad.&quot;</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession12" href="#ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">While the house was being prepared for our reception, I heard
nothing of Maxwell. I thought of him often, and I sometimes fancied that Barbara
was not so ignorant as myself of his whereabouts and doings—a supposition which
proved to be true, but his name was not mentioned by either of us. In looking
back upon those days I can see that I was acting a part as well as Barbara. I
was miserably conscious of it at the time, but it did not strike me as it
strikes me now. Words of affection had no meaning, and we knew it—and knowing
it, nursed in our hearts the belief that the other was a hypocrite. I have no
desire to show myself in a favorable light to Barbara&#39;s disadvantage. Her
judgment of me was warped by her passion for drink, and my judgment of her was
perhaps harsher than it should have been because of the bitter disappointment
under which I labored. I could not always be patient, I could not always endure
in silence; she stung me by her sly cunning, by the artful entanglements she
wove for me, by the detestable assumption of religious fervor which she used to
mask the degrading vice which made my life a hell. I had to be continually on
the alert to avoid public exposure, and in this endeavor Annette was useful, for
she did what she could to shield her mistress. Self-interest was her motive, for
Barbara was continually making her presents of money and articles of jewelry and
dress. I was quite aware that she was my enemy, that when she spoke of me she
lied and traduced me, but I could find no fault with her when she was in my
presence. It may be that she held me in contempt because I did not beat or kill
my wife.</p>

<p>We gave up our flat, and took up our quarters in the home in which before my
marriage I had hoped to live an honorable and happy life. That hope was dead,
and in my contemplations of the future I could see no ray of light. There was
but one source of relief—work. Hard toil, exhausting manual labor would have
done me good; failing that, I had my pen. My visits to the vice-haunted haunts
of London had supplied me with a theme.</p>

<p>&quot;What does my dear boy think of it?&quot; Barbara asked, on the morning we entered
the house.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks very clean and new,&quot; I replied, as we walked through the rooms.</p>

<p>&quot;It is what I aimed at, dear. We are going to commence a new life. No more
wrangles or disagreements, no more misunderstandings, everything that is
unpleasant wiped off the slate. I am never going to worry you again. Can I say
more than that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall be all the happier, Barbara, if you keep that in mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;&quot;Of course I shall keep it in mind. And you, too, John—you will keep it in
mind, and not worry me. Fair play&#39;s a jewel. This is my morning room. Isn&#39;t it
sweet? And this,&quot; opening a communicating door, &quot;is my prayer room, my very,
very own. I shall come here whenever I feel naughty, and pray to be good. Oh,
what a consolation there is in prayer!&quot;</p>

<p>The walls were lined with pictures of sacred subjects and moral exordiums in
Oxford frames. There was an altar with prayer books ostentatiously arranged, and
a cushion for her to kneel upon when at her devotions. She looked at me for
approval, and I said that prayer chastened and purified.</p>

<p>&quot;It is what it will do for me, dear John. However earnest and wishful to do
right one may be there are always little crosses. I intended this room for your
study, but I felt that you would rather I put it to its present use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then there is no study in the house for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear. We can&#39;t have everything we wish. I thought you might take a room
elsewhere for your literary work. You can go and scribble there whenever you
feel inclined; it will be so much better for you. There will be nothing to
disturb you—no sweeping and scrubbing of floors and difficulties with servants,
which put men out so. You see how I thought of you while I was arranging things.
There are some nice quiet streets off the Strand where you can take chambers and
be comfortable and cosy. If you had a business in the city you would have to go
to it every morning, so it is just as if you were a business man. We shall dine
at home at half-past six. I shall expect you to be very punctual, or the cooking
will be spoilt and the cook will give notice. Oh, the worry of servants! But I
take all that on myself.&quot;</p>

<p>I was not displeased at the arrangement. Had it been left to me I should have
chosen it, so I said I was quite satisfied, and she clapped her hands and kissed
me.</p>

<p>&quot;I have an agreeable surprise for you,&quot; she then said. &quot;Maxwell is in
London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have seen him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, every day almost. He has been of immense assistance to me in
choosing furniture and wall paper, and managing the people who did the work. If
it hadn&#39;t been for him I should have been dreadfully imposed upon, and it would
have been ever so much out of your pocket. You will be glad to hear that he will
dine with us this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>I said I should be glad to see him; and indeed it was a matter of
indifference to me, but I determined to be on my guard against him.</p>

<p>&quot;I was angry with him,&quot; she continued, &quot;for not meeting us in Geneva, as he
promised; but he couldn&#39;t, poor fellow. He met with an accident, and had to lay
up in a poky little village in Italy. It is such a comfort to me that he is near
us. There is no one like our own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he living in London?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the present. He has been unfortunate and has lost a lot of money—the
stupid fellow is so trustful. He went security for a friend and was taken in.
Don&#39;t you go security for people, John, it&#39;s a mistake. I have another surprise
for you. &#39;Our first dinner in our dear little home shall be an unexpected
pleasure to John,&#39; I said to myself, when I was looking over my letters, and
came across one from your mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My stepmother, Barbara.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s all the same. Such a pretty, friendly letter; so full of good advice!
Young wives need advice, and old wives can give it them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when did you hear from her?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t you remember? It was when we were engaged.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember that I wrote to her of our engagement, and that she did not reply
to me. She wrote to you instead. Is that the letter you refer to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You told me that you tore up the letter the moment you read it, and that she
must be an awful woman. I distinctly recollect your saying that we could do
without her and her beautiful son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a memory you have, John! Or are you making it up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not making it up. You did not tear up the letter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said with a beaming smile, &quot;I kept it by me, and I am sure you are
mistaken in what you think I said. I did not show it to you because I knew you
had some feeling against her and Louis, and I didn&#39;t want to annoy you. I am not
the woman to make mischief between such near relations. Little differences will
arise, and it is our duty to try and smooth them over. That is what I did, and
you will be delighted to hear that they are content to let byegones be byegones,
and are burning to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will think over it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have thought over it for you, dear. They are coming to dinner this
evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you consider it right, Barbara, to invite them without consulting me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, my dear. I am a peacemaker. Our housewarming will be quite a family
party.&quot;</p>

<p>I submitted, wondering to what length Barbara would go in her duplicity, and
whether she or I was mistaken in our recollection of the circumstances in
connection with this particular letter. I did not wonder long. I knew that I was
right.</p>

<p>Maxwell made his appearance an hour before dinner, and—having made up my
mind—I received him with a cordiality which I did not feel.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here you are,&quot; he said, with a searching glance at me, &quot;a regular
married man after your lovely holiday tour. Enjoyed yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara has given you a full account, no doubt,&quot; I replied, all the evil
that was in my nature aroused by his mocking voice; &quot;judge from that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must be a model husband, then,&quot; he said, laughing quietly to himself,
&quot;and she a model wife. I owe you an apology for not joining you on the
Continent. The fact is&quot;—he looked to see that Barbara was out of hearing—&quot;I was
not traveling alone, and upon considering the matter I came to the conclusion
that our company might not suit you. A question of morals, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am obliged to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For keeping away? Good. One to you. Where are you going, Barbara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Domestic affairs,&quot; she replied. &quot;To do the cooking.&quot; And she left the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Was your accident very serious?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Accident!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What accident?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you did not meet with one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not that I am aware of. I had the jolliest time.&quot;</p>

<p>I dropped the subject, and we talked of other matters, with a lame attempt at
civility on both sides, until Barbara re-entered the room, when he cried out:</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Barbara, what is this about my meeting with an accident on the
Continent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did meet with an accident,&quot; she said, boldly.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I? Well, then, I did.&quot; He looked me full in the face, and laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;I am disgusted with you, Maxwell,&quot; Barbara exclaimed. &quot;Don&#39;t pay any
attention to him, John; you can&#39;t believe a word out of his mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon he laughed still more boisterously, winding up with, &quot;Don&#39;t expect
me to take a hand in your matrimonial squabbles; you must settle them
yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have any, do we, John?&quot; said Barbara, in her sweetest tone.</p>

<p>Maxwell appeared to be immensely amused, and they had a bantering bout, in
which I took neither share nor interest. When they appealed to me I replied in
monosyllables, until Barbara said:</p>

<p>&quot;There, you have offended him. Ask his pardon immediately. I won&#39;t have my
dear boy annoyed.&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled as he held out his hand, which I was compelled to take to
avoid an open rupture. &quot;I ask your pardon, John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; said Barbara, gaily. &quot;For goodness sake, don&#39;t let us
have any quarreling on our house-warming day.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt as if I were in a hornets&#39; nest.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards my stepmother and Louis were announced, and Barbara
ran forward to welcome them.</p>

<p>&quot;I am so glad you have come! There&#39;s no need of an introduction, is there? I
am John&#39;s wife, Barbara. You must call me Barbara—yes, I insist upon it. This is
my brother Maxwell. Maxwell, Mrs. Fordham—how funny there should be two of us!
And this is your son, Mr. Louis Fordham, John&#39;s brother. I hate formality. You
mustn&#39;t be shocked at my saying that I am a bit of a Bohemian. So is Maxwell,
but he goes farther than I do, of course, as he is a man. I hope you are one,
too, Mr. Louis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will become one,&quot; said Louis, gallantly, &quot;under your instructions. How do
you do, John? What a pretty house you&#39;ve got!&quot;</p>

<p>I shook hands with him and with my stepmother. Louis was cordial enough in
his manner; my stepmother was frigid. Years had passed since I had seen her or
Louis, but she had not forgotten, and never would forget. Only with her death
would the old animosity die out. She was no older in appearance; Louis had grown
into a well-built man, and she doted on him, as she had done since his birth. A
good-looking man, too, but for the scar on his forehead. As I raised my eyes to
it—with no evil meaning, I am sure—the blood rushed into it, and it became
scarlet, while a dark look flashed into my stepmother&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;He will bear it with him to his grave,&quot; said my stepmother.</p>

<p>&quot;What a pity!&quot; said Barbara, who had observed this bye-play. &quot;How did it
happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;John gave it him,&quot; said my stepmother, coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;But they were boys then,&quot; said Barbara, defending me maliciously, &quot;and boys
are so cruel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The boy is father to the man,&quot; remarked my stepmother, with venomous
emphasis.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, John,&quot; said Barbara, &quot;what have you to say to it?&quot;</p>

<p>My impulse was to reply that the story was false, but I checked myself in
time, and simply said:</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. Either my memory or yours&quot;—to my stepmother—&quot;is at fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have a shocking memory, John,&quot; said Barbara. &quot;Not your fault, my
dear—you were born with it. We all forgive you, don&#39;t we, Mrs. Fordham—and you,
too, Louis? It would be dreadful if we nursed every little grievance, and saved
disagreeable things for future use against one another. Let us talk of something
pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have the temper of an angel, Barbara,&quot; ejaculated Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;It runs in our family,&quot; returned Barbara, casting up her eyes, &quot;and we won&#39;t
boast of it. Whether we are married or single, we don&#39;t lie on beds of roses.&quot;</p>

<p>By the time the dinner came to an end the inuendoes, the sly thrusts, the
holding up of my wife as a martyr to my disparagement had become unbearable. The
ladies retired to the drawing-room, and I refused to stop and drink with Louis
and Maxwell. Strolling from the house I lit a cigar, and upon my return the
guests were preparing to take their departure.</p>

<p>&quot;Such a pleasant evening,&quot; said my stepmother. &quot;I hope you will turn over a
new leaf, John, and be kind to your wife. You have a treasure in her. You must
come and dine with us, soon.&quot;</p>

<p>I stood at the street door while she and the men entered a cab together.
Barbara, standing by my side, waved her handkerchief to them. The moment the cab
was out of sight she turned upon me like a fury.</p>

<p>&quot;You beast!&quot; she cried. &quot;Is that the way you treat my friends?&quot;</p>

<p>And she ran into the house.</p>

<p>Sadly enough I followed her, in doubt of the best course to pursue. She
solved the doubt by saying:</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to my room. You will find the spare room ready for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a bad commencement, Barbara,&quot; I ventured to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank yourself for it,&quot; she retorted, and disappeared.</p>

<p>I possessed a small library of books, which I had sent to the house, and I
endeavored to while away the time by reading. But I could not fix my attention;
I turned over page after page without any comprehension of the printed words.
And so I passed the time in a dull, lethargic state until eleven o&#39;clock struck.
I left my book and set myself to the old task of reviewing the incidents of the
day, with the same old result. If the fault were mine there must be some defect
in my understanding of passing events in which I was concerned. My melancholy
musings were interrupted by the sound of Barbara&#39;s voice in the room above. She
was laughing and singing—a babble of unconnected lines, the laughter of a woman
under the influence of drink. The door of her room was opened and shut, and I
heard Annette descend the stairs. I intercepted her.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter with your mistress?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is unwell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your errand now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame has left her medicine in the dining-room; I am fetching it for her.&quot;</p>

<p>I left her to fulfill her errand, but kept watch on the landing above. Again
I intercepted her. In her hands, as I suspected, was the decanter of brandy.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that the medicine you were sent for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could not find it, monsieur. I thought this would do her good; she is
depressed, and needs something strengthening.&quot;</p>

<p>There was no sign of confusion on the woman&#39;s face; she was calm and
composed.</p>

<p>&quot;Go down again and search for the medicine you were sent for,&quot; I said, taking
the decanter from her.</p>

<p>&quot;But, monsieur, I have already sought for it, and cannot find it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To search again, then, would be useless?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite useless, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can go to bed, Annette. I will attend to your mistress.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is impossible, monsieur. Madame requires me. Madame engaged me; I am her
servant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are my servant also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, monsieur. It is madame who orders me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am master here. Do as I bid you. Go to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>While this colloquy was proceeding there was silence in Barbara&#39;s room.
Suddenly the door was dashed open, and my wife appeared, her dress disordered,
her eyes inflamed, her face distorted by the hysterical passion of the habitual
drunkard. As in a flash, I saw the inroads the bestial vice was making upon her
beauty.</p>

<p>&quot;Beast, beast, beast!&quot; she shrieked, throwing herself upon me as I recoiled
from the horrible sight. By engaging in a disgraceful struggle I might have
retained the decanter of brandy, but I was not equal to it. She wrested it from
me, and clutching Annette&#39;s arm, she dragged her into the room, the lock of
which I heard turned a moment afterwards. Then came to my ears her mad laughter
at the triumph she had achieved.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession13" href="#ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">If I have dwelt at greater length than I intended upon the
incidents which made their fatal mark upon the early months of my married life,
it is because I wish Barbara&#39;s character to be clearly understood, and because
they supply a pregnant index to what followed. The first night I spent in our
new home was a prelude to innumerable nights of the same nature. Safe from
observation and free to indulge in her besotted habits, with a willing tool at
her beck and call in the person of Annette, with a helpless protector chained to
her by bonds which he could not break, she found herself absolute mistress of a
drunkard&#39;s hellish heaven. She reveled in it, and gave her passions free play.
Day after day, night after night, I had by my side a creature who had reached
the lowest depths of bestial degradation, and whose one aim in life seemed to be
to reach a lower still. She was a large-framed woman with a magnificent
constitution, or she would soon have succumbed and become a driveling idiot.
Throughout all, singular to say, she preserved her cunning, and the expedients
by which she hedged herself in and kept her besetting vice from the knowledge of
others except myself and Annette, were nothing short of marvelous in their
ingenuity. The room she called her prayer room was her sanctuary, and it was
there, attended by Annette, that she freely indulged. She acquired, indeed, a
reputation for sanctity, and even our servants were deceived by her clever
devices. Annette became housekeeper and the nominal mistress of the
establishment, and from her they received their orders. They saw their real
mistress only when she was sober, and then she spoke kindly and was liberal to
them. When she secluded herself they were given to understand that she was ill
or at her devotions. She was supposed to suffer from a mysterious disorder, and
her driveling screams in the middle of the nights were attributed to pain. I
subsequently learned that they were often attributed to my beating her and
knocking her about.</p>

<p>I recall the day when she sat at the table with a livid bruise on her cheek,
caused by her falling against the sharp corner of a piece of furniture. The
parlor-maid assisted Annette to apply hot fomentations to the bruise, and when,
later in the day, I noticed the frightened, horrified looks the girl cast at me,
I knew that she had been told the lie that I had struck my wife. Against these
calumnies I had no defense. In the kitchen I was regarded as a monster of
cruelty, and the servants shrank aside as I passed them. Before the domestics
Barbara invariably addressed me in frightened, humble tones. She kept her
revilings for my private ear, the only witness of the scenes between us being
Annette.</p>

<p>The character foisted upon me was not confined to the house. Our servants
related shameful stories against me to their friends in the neighborhood, who,
in their turn, poured these stories into their mistresses&#39; ears. Wives and
mothers looked darkly at me, and those with whom I had become acquainted did not
return my bow. I was completely and effectually ostracised. Under these
persecutions was it any wonder that I felt myself becoming hardened? My nature
was changed. I grew habitually morose and savage, and by my manner defied my
traducers. This made matters worse for me, and gave color to the stories of
systematic cruelty laid to my charge. After awhile I slept in the spare room
alone, and offered up prayers of thankfulness that we had no children. It was
indeed a blessing for which I could not be sufficiently grateful.</p>

<p>One evening when we were at dinner, and Barbara was toying with her food and
sighing in the presence of the maid who waited at table, I suggested that she
should call in a doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not a doctor I require,&quot; she said, gazing at me with mournful
significance. &quot;Oh, John, if only you——&quot; And then she checked herself, as if she
would not say anything to my discredit before the servant.</p>

<p>&quot;Finish the sentence,&quot; I said. &quot;If I only what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not force me to speak,&quot; she cried, in an imploring tone.</p>

<p>Bursting into tears she rose from the table and left the room.</p>

<p>What clearer evidence of my barbarity could be supplied? The maid would have
been bereft of sense not to have understood the implication, and there is no
doubt that she took the tale down to her fellow servants in the kitchen. Before
them, at meals, she never drank, but it was a common practice with her when we
and Annette were together at dinner, to help herself to copious draughts of
brandy. I no longer remonstrated with her; she would have added to my distress
by drinking deeper.</p>

<p>In all these tricks she was assisted by Maxwell and my stepmother. Louis, for
the most part, was a passive spectator. Maxwell drank with her and laughed. My
stepmother said:</p>

<p>&quot;See what you are driving her to. You are breaking her heart. I always knew
what would happen if you married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are saying what is false, because you hate me,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I am speaking the truth,&quot; she retorted, &quot;and truly I have no cause to love
you. It is my opinion you have some wicked scheme in view. But there will be a
judgment upon you for all your cleverness. You robbed me; you robbed Louis of
his patrimony. What good is the money doing you?&quot;</p>

<p>It is well I had matters apart from my domestic affairs to occupy me, or my
mind would have lost its balance entirely. In accordance with the plan Barbara
had laid down for me, I took a small set of chambers in one of the streets
leading from the Strand to the river—the locality she had herself
proposed—consisting of three rooms, a sitting-room, bedroom, and bathroom; and
there I pursued my literary labors. The chambers were at the top of the house,
and the sitting-room looked out upon the river. How happy could I have been
there, had it not been for the living weight which held me down! Gladly every
morning did I leave my home, sadly every evening did I return to it.</p>

<p>At first I wrote a few short stories, which I sent to the magazines. They
were refused. Every fresh rejection brought disappointment with it, but
disheartened me only a short time. When my manuscripts came back to me I read
them carefully, found faults in them, re-wrote them, and tried again, with the
same result. Thus a year passed, and I had not advanced a step. Two or three
times in the course of this year Barbara visited me.</p>

<p>&quot;You are happy here,&quot; she said, and I did not gainsay her. &quot;You like it
better than your own home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was your own proposition,&quot; I replied. &quot;Will nothing satisfy you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was not my proposition,&quot; she said. &quot;You chose this yourself, and you have
assignations here with creatures you love better than me. Oh, I know why you
spend the day in these rooms. Do you think I am blind to the life you are
living.&quot;</p>

<p>She carried her venom to the length of tearing up manuscripts upon which I
was engaged; I submitted to this awhile, but eventually I protected myself by
locking up my papers when I heard her knock at the door. She was furious at my
refusal to give her duplicate keys to the chambers.</p>

<p>&quot;A clear proof,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions I proposed a separation, and offered to settle upon
her half the money I possessed, so long as we remained apart.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you give it me in a lump?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I answered, &quot;there must be a guarantee that you will not violate the
conditions of the deed, which would be drawn up and signed by both of us. You
shall have the interest of the money. If I die before you it will all be yours
without restriction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, my dear,&quot; she said. &quot;I prefer things as they are. You will not
get rid of me so easily. You would divorce me if it were in your power. Of
course you won&#39;t answer that. But you will never get the chance, love. I am
acquainted with the grounds upon which a divorce can be obtained. You shall have
no reason to say that I am not a true and faithful wife to you.&quot;</p>

<p>And, indeed, upon the score of faithfulness—in its legal sense—I entertained
no doubts. She had but one love—brandy.</p>

<p>While I was endeavoring to obtain a footing in the literary field by means of
short stories, I was preparing a series of articles upon the curse of the
land—drink—drawing upon actual facts and real life for my pen and ink pictures.
By good fortune I obtained an introduction to the editor of a paper, the columns
of which were open to social subjects, and I submitted a few of these articles
to him. He approved of them, and suggesting certain alterations, which I agreed
to make, consented to use them. His paper was one which did not admit of signed
contributions, and had it been otherwise I should not have put my name to them,
my domestic troubles on the same theme being a bar to such a course. The editor
did not inquire into the source from which I obtained the facts for my
descriptions of the effects of the awful vice; he was content with my method of
treatment and with my literary style.</p>

<p>&quot;Just one word of advice,&quot; he said, &quot;don&#39;t shrink from speaking broadly and
plainly. It is a burning question, and you can&#39;t put it too strongly. I am not
so well up in the subject as yourself, but I should say, even if a man drew
entirely upon his imagination, he could not paint more striking pictures than
reality can supply. The successful artist paints from life and nature.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What I describe,&quot; I replied, &quot;is what I have seen. Nothing more horrible can
be met in the Vision of Hell. This city of shame and sin is full of little
hells, and if there is any truth in pulpit sermons and religious ministrations,
in every little hell souls are daily being damned.&quot;</p>

<p>He threw a searching glance upon me. &quot;I like that. Don&#39;t forget the metaphor;
use it in one of the early articles. Some writers keep their big plums till the
last; it is a mistake. Fairy tales can be written on a Swiss mountain or an
Italian lake, but to do justice to such a subject as yours you must dig into
Babylon&#39;s crust; you need the pest-houses of civilization, the hog-like natures
of men and women familiar with crime and poverty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The evil is not confined to hovels,&quot; I remarked, &quot;nor to the criminal
classes. Mansions of the well-to-do supply fruitful material.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, do your best,&quot; he said. &quot;We shall create a sensation.&quot;</p>

<p>We did. My articles were quoted far and near. Writing under a burning sense
of wrong I was not sparing of epithet and denunciation. I worked at fever heat,
and was often appalled at what I wrote, but it went into print with scarcely the
alteration of a word. Had I written under my own name I might have become a
celebrity.</p>

<p>In one of my articles I touched upon the marriage tie in relation to the
evil. I described a home—a type of many—in which the wife was a confirmed
dipsomaniac; another, in which the husband was drunk every day of his life. They
were cases which came under my own eye in the localities where I pursued my
investigations. From the lips of the sufferers themselves I received the
terrible details of the gradual sinking into the slough of despair. Here was the
wretched husband, once a bright mechanic earning a fair wage, whose wife&#39;s
filthy habits had brought ruin upon him—hopeless, irremediable ruin. Vainly had
he striven to reform her, vainly had he pointed out to her the sure consequences
of her dissipation. Coming home at night from his work he found his rooms in
darkness, his hungry children lying almost naked on the bare boards, and his
wife drunk in the nearest gin palace. It had become a common occurrence. She
pawned the beds, the furniture, the children&#39;s clothes and his own, again and
yet again, and when he dragged her from the public-house she lay through the
night, gibbering at the awful sights her diseased imagination conjured up. He
replaced the furniture, he bought new beds and clothing, he gave his children
food, and when his wife was able to crawl out again, off she crept to the
pawnbroker to repeat her evil work. The children had grown stunted and deformed,
their rags hung loosely on their shrunken limbs, like starving dogs they nosed
the gutters for offal. &quot;My God, my God!&quot; he cried, the tears streaming down his
face. &quot;What shall I do? How shall I save my children? How shall I save myself?&quot;
His voice sank to a whisper. &quot;One night I shall kill her, and there will be
murder on my soul!&quot;</p>

<p>In the other case it was the husband who drank, who would not work, who
starved his wife and children, and beat them till their flesh was covered with
livid bruises. It was the wife who told me the story. &quot;If it were not for my
children,&quot; she moaned, &quot;I would make a hole in the water.&quot; It was not my habit
to make more than a passing comment upon my descriptions of real and suffering
life as it is to be seen to-day in the fester-spots of London. I had wished to
do so, but was requested by my editor to put some restriction upon myself in
this respect. &quot;Leave that,&quot; he said, &quot;to the editorial pen.&quot; At the end of the
article in which I narrated these two cases, I wrote: &quot;And these poor creatures
are, by the Church and the so-called laws of God, chained to a living curse
which blights, destroys, and damns the innocent.&quot; The words were allowed to
stand.</p>

<p>On the following day a powerful leading article was written by the editor, in
which a change in the law of divorce was imperatively demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;Confirmed drunkenness,&quot; he said, &quot;is a crime against the true laws of God
and man; it is far worse than adultery, and more than a sufficient cause for
separation. It is not alone that humanity demands it, but could God make Himself
heard in this sinful world there would be a Divine mandate to enforce it.&quot; Other
papers took up the subject. One popular journal (the season being over, and the
House not sitting) made it a theme for the usual yearly correspondence, and
columns of letters were printed every day—from despairing husbands and wives
approving, from the clergy protesting, from politicians shilly-shallying.
Meanwhile my articles had come to an end.</p>

<p>There was no change in my home, except for the worse, and I grew to hate it,
to hate all who visited it, to hate myself. I had as little authority in it as
any chance guest. I breakfasted, dined, and slept there—and, for variation,
there were the scenes I had with Barbara. The lies that were circulated as to my
brutality towards her bore fruit, and I was shunned by every soul in the
neighborhood. Not a person I met there had a smile or a cordial word for me, and
not for one sober hour did Barbara relax her cunning. In her mad fits she was
visible only to me and Annette; when she went about the house or was seen in the
streets her sad, listless ways (she was always sad when sober) were apparent to
all, and her conspicuous ill-health was attributed to my conduct. It was the
popular belief that I was &quot;killing her by inches.&quot; I heard the words uttered by
one of our servants to a servant in the adjoining house, and the indignant
comment upon them—&quot;Brute!&quot;</p>

<p>Maxwell tried to borrow money from me, but I was sufficiently incensed to
refuse him. &quot;Not another shilling while I live,&quot; I said, and he replied that I
would live to repent it. Scoundrel as he was, he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>The cases of the two poor homes ruined by a drunken husband and a drunken
wife, which I have just narrated, drove my thoughts upon my own—and indeed it
may have been because of the position in which I stood that I sifted them to the
bottom. They had a peculiar fascination for me.</p>

<p>But even if the law of divorce were so altered as to rescue those who are
driven to despair, sometimes to crime, by this frightful vice—which I pray may
soon be so—a man situated as I was would find no relief in it. The shame would
have to be proved, and the web which had been spun around me was of so cunning a
nature that proof was impossible in my case. On the contrary, indeed; all the
evidence, except my bare statements, would be turned against myself.</p>

<p>As an instance of the base arts employed to still further entangle and
incriminate me I recount the following circumstances. Whose devilish ingenuity
first conceived the idea I never discovered.</p>

<p>The spare room in which I slept was at the back of the house, and its window
faced the window of another house, used also, I believe, as a bedroom. I stood
in front of this window, shaving, one morning; the blind was up and the day was
bright. While the razor was at my cheek Barbara rushed into the room, crying at
the top of her voice:</p>

<p>&quot;John—John—John! For mercy&#39;s sake, don&#39;t!&quot; And as she spoke she threw herself
upon me.</p>

<p>Fearful lest the razor should cut her I threw it away, but not before I had
gashed my cheek, causing blood to flow. Then, observing that she was in her
nightdress and that the bosom was open, I quickly drew down the blind.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; I inquired, bitterly. &quot;Do you fear that I
intend to kill myself?&quot;</p>

<p>Her only answer was a series of hysterical shrieks which could be heard a
long distance off. For a few moments I thought she had gone mad, and I stooped
to raise her from the floor, upon which she had fallen.</p>

<p>&quot;For mercy&#39;s sake, for mercy&#39;s sake!&quot; she screamed, and in the midst of the
confusion Annette entered the room and led her mistress away. I followed her
into the passage, the blood running down my face, and there upon the stairs were
the servants, who had naturally been alarmed by Barbara&#39;s screams, and had run
up to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Go down,&quot; said Annette, speaking to them in a tone of command. &quot;Madame is
ill—very, very ill. I will attend to her.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not see my wife again that day; the door of her room was locked against
me. To all my inquiries after her Annette replied:</p>

<p>&quot;She is more composed; she will recover in a few days, perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to see her, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame will not be seen by any one but me. She ordered me to say so to you.&quot;</p>

<p>I had, perforce, to give up the attempt.</p>

<p>I thought of the scene during the day; it was of a different nature from
those to which I was accustomed, but there was something strange in it which I
could not unfathom. Finally I came to the conclusion that Barbara&#39;s malady was
developing itself in a new direction, and the last thought in my mind was that
anything more than generally prejudicial to my character would come of it.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a href="#ch14" name="confession14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Towards the end of that week I had invited my friend the editor to
take a mid-day chop with me. He had put my name down as a candidate for
admission into a literary club which I was anxious to join, and there was a
difficulty in regard to my qualification. Had the articles I wrote for his paper
been signed with my name, there would have been no question as to my being
properly qualified, but they had been published anonymously, and I was
personally unknown to the members. My proposer had vouched for me and had passed
his word, but it was not deemed sufficient; they wanted proof positive, and this
nettled him. Certain members of this committee had spoken to him privately, and
had advised him to withdraw his candidate, but he had set his heart upon the
matter, and was determined to carry me through. He held an influential position
in the club, and it seemed to him that his influence would be weakened if he
beat a retreat. And now on this day he came to tell me that the difficulty was
at an end.</p>

<p>&quot;Somehow or other,&quot; he said, &quot;it has leaked out that you are the writer of
those articles, and your election is assured. The committee meet in a fortnight,
and the vote will be unanimous.&quot;</p>

<p>I was greatly disturbed. It had been my earnest desire to keep my name from
being associated with the exposures I had made. Had I been unmarried and free,
it would have been my pride that the world should know and give me my meed of
praise, but married to Barbara, and with the curse of drink in my own home, I
shrank from public gaze. A foreboding of evil stole upon me.</p>

<p>&quot;The fellows are wild to meet you,&quot; continued my friend, &quot;and every member of
the committee has promised a white ball. This has set my mind at ease about you,
for it is a serious matter being pilled in such a club. I know a case or two
where a black ball has meant social death. I should have felt it more than you.
You see, I am your sponsor. &#39;What do you say now to my candidate being
qualified?&#39; I said to two members who were dead against you on the score of your
being a stranger. A man crept in once, and we discovered he was a blackleg. He
gave us a chance, and we expelled him. Since then a strict watch has been kept
upon candidates. Before it leaked out who you really were, they wanted to know
whether you were a gentleman, a man of honor and good character, one it would be
agreeable to mix with—what we call a clubbable man. They have no doubts now. You
will be cordially welcomed by a band of as good fellows as can be met with in
London, and you may look upon yourself as one of the inner circle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry my anonymity as a writer is destroyed,&quot; I said, speaking with
reserve. &quot;It lessens the value of one&#39;s work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; was his reply. &quot;Up to a certain point it is all very
well, but when a man has won his spurs everybody is ready to shake hands with
him. What have you to be ashamed of, and why shouldn&#39;t you reap your reward? You
wrote those things devilishly well; I was amazed at some of your word pictures.
You must have had rare opportunities of studying the subject. &#39;That man is a
vivisectionist,&#39; said a very good judge.&quot;</p>

<p>It would have been better for me had I made a clean breast of it there and
then, had I confided to him the awful sorrow which lay like a poisonous worm in
my heart. But I let the opportunity slip.</p>

<p>He remained with me a couple of hours, and urged me to contribute a second
series of articles on the same subject.</p>

<p>&quot;You have drawn your illustrations for the first series from the poor,&quot; he
said; &quot;draw those for your second series from the rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forget,&quot; I rejoined, &quot;that the skeletons of the rich are kept in iron
closets with patent locks. The skeletons of the lower classes stand at open
doors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Invent your instances,&quot; he suggested. &quot;With such a rich store of material as
you have at command, you can&#39;t go wrong. That is an ugly gash you have on your
cheek. Cut yourself shaving, I suppose.&quot; I nodded. &quot;Ah, I knew a man who was
frightened to take a razor in his hand for fear he would cut his throat.&quot;</p>

<p>Inwardly resolving not to execute the commission, I promised to consider the
matter, and he took his departure. I walked with him to his office, and then
mounted an omnibus and rode a few miles, thinking of the disclosure that had
been made and dreading to see my name in the papers. But I did not know how to
prevent it. We live in an age of personalism, and very little of the private
life of public men can be hidden from the Paul Prys of journalism. Almost to a
certainty it would come under the notice of Maxwell and my stepmother, who would
be ready to weave mischief out of it. Surely no man ever shrank from fame as I
did. The prospect chilled me to the heart.</p>

<p>It is anticipating events by a few hours to record that on the following
morning I received a letter from the editor informing me that he was over-worked
and was going to Germany for a rest. He had designed to go earlier, but while
there was a doubt of my election he felt it to be a point of honor not to leave
London. He intended now to enjoy his holiday. I gathered from his letter that he
would be absent a week.</p>

<p>At five o&#39;clock I returned to my chambers, and my heart sank when I saw a
huddled heap of clothes lying in front of my door—a woman in a drunken sleep.</p>

<p>I had no need to stoop to ascertain who it was. By her side was an empty
brandy bottle, which she must have purchased on the road; the satchel on the
ground was large enough only for the spirit flask I found in it—empty, as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>I carried her into my sitting-room; her drunken stupor was of too profound a
nature for her to make any resistance. It was as much as I could do to
accomplish the task, for Barbara had grown very stout and unwieldy. Her
condition was most disgraceful; I had seen nothing more degrading and shameful
during my recent investigations. Probably to obtain ease for her feet, which she
had complained of lately as being swollen, she had unlaced her boots, her
clothes were torn and untidy, her hands ungloved, her hair hung loose about her
bloated face, her lips and mouth were unsightly with the stains and dribble of
liquor.</p>

<p>It was of the utmost importance that I should get her home without attracting
attention to myself. A large latitude is allowed to men who occupy chambers, but
in this particular house were old established offices of respectable firms, and
there was a special clause in my lease as to doing anything which might cause
annoyance to my neighbors.</p>

<p>I rang for the housekeeper, and slipping half-a-sovereign into her hand,
begged her to assist me. She did not put any awkward questions to me, but called
up her servant. Between them they repaired as far as they were able the disorder
in my wife&#39;s dress and appearance, and, the offices in the house being closed—it
was now past six o&#39;clock—we managed to half carry, half support her to the
street door, and into a four-wheel cab. Thus, on this occasion at least, was
open exposure averted, but I thought, Where shall I find rest if this fresh form
of persecutions be added to the list? And indeed I had an assurance of it in a
subsequent scene with Barbara, during which she said, &quot;You are living an
infamous life away from your home. I will follow and disgrace you wherever you
go.&quot;</p>

<p>A still bitterer blow was to fall upon me, a blow which drove me to the brink
of despair. At the end of a week, the limit of time fixed by the editor for his
holiday, I wrote him, and as no notice was taken of my letter, I concluded that
he had not returned from his tour. My intention was to reveal my story, to
acquaint him with Barbara&#39;s resolve to follow and disgrace me, and to request
him to withdraw my name from candidature for his club. In his absence this
course could not be taken, and I was compelled to await the course of events.</p>

<p>On the day following that on which the committee meeting was held, I received
a letter from my proposer, which overwhelmed me. He informed me that I had been
balloted for by the committee, and had been unanimously blackballed. He
expressed his approval of this result. &quot;I had the power,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to withdraw
your name, but having been made acquainted with the infamies you have practised,
I considered it due to the committee to disclose the matters to them, expressing
at the same time my sincere regret that I should have been so misled as to place
your name on the candidates&#39; book. The unanimous blackball was given as a
warning to careless members to be exceedingly careful as to the character of the
persons they desired to introduce into a club of gentlemen.&quot; He then proceeded
with a minute narration of the charges brought against me, and I learned the
names of my accusers. First, my wife; then her brother Maxwell; then my
stepmother and her son Louis; then Annette; then the servants in our house; then
an independent witness in the person of a gentleman who, with Maxwell and Louis,
had been stationed at the window of the house opposite to that of my bedroom,
and had witnessed the scene between Barbara and me when I was shaving. This
scene, which had been cunningly prepared for my benefit, was construed into an
attack I had made upon my wife with my razor; her agonized shrieks were appeals
for mercy; my rapid drawing down of the blind was due to my fear that my
barbarous behavior might be witnessed from the opposite house. It was
represented that I was a man who habitually concealed his vices beneath a veil
of gentle melancholy, as of one who was himself oppressed, and that my
systematic cruelty had broken down my wife&#39;s health and made her a confirmed
invalid.</p>

<p>There was a still more horrible charge. With a morbid craving for notoriety I
had plied Barbara with brandy, and had made her an object lesson in the various
stages of intoxication, so that my descriptions might be true to nature. She was
my model, a living victim whom I was deliberately driving to madness.</p>

<p>It appears that Maxwell having learnt through the public journals that I was
the author of the articles on Drink which had attracted general attention,
called upon the editor of the paper in which they were published, and brought
these accusations against me. At first the editor refused to listen,
characterizing the charges as too horrible for belief and as being utterly
inconsistent with the opinion he had formed of me. Maxwell, however, persisted,
and the editor, impressed by his earnestness, consented to see the witnesses and
hear what they had to say. For the last week a private court of inquiry had been
made behind my back. The editor was convinced. Shocked at the revelations he
advised my wife to apply for redress in the divorce court, but she said she
would rather die than bring that shame upon me; she still clung to me, still
trusted that obedience and affection would win me to a better comprehension of
my duty towards her; and I was warned by my correspondent to consider my
position while there was yet time, and not to lightly throw away the treasure of
a good woman&#39;s love. He required, he concluded, no further contributions from my
pen, and wherever his influence could be exerted it would be to prevail upon
other editors not to accept my writings. His last words were—&quot;Henceforth we are
strangers.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew what this letter meant. The fiendish malice of the enemies in my home
had brought upon me social and moral death. I wandered forth like Cain, accursed
of men, and though, unlike him, there was no guilt upon my soul, the reflection
brought me no comfort. My life had come to wreck. A gulf of black despair lay
before me.</p>

<p>Men have been driven mad by physical torture, and under the pressure of
mental agony some have lost their reason. Upon no other grounds can I account
for my conduct after this last crushing blow fell upon me. I offer no excuses.
My wife&#39;s theory—put forward in palliation of her own misconduct—that man is not
responsible for his actions, is entirely opposed to my view. For what I did
during that dolorous time I was and am accountable. I sinned, and have been
punished; and little did I deserve the heavenly consolation administered to me
in the darkest hour of my life.</p>

<p>I did not go home that day or night. Dazed and forlorn, I wandered, an
outcast, through the streets and over the bridges.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession15" href="#ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">It was well on in the afternoon when I entered my house. I had
been to my chambers, and having transacted some business which the change in my
affairs seemed to me to render imperative, I gave up the keys, and turned my
back forever upon the brighter side of my existence. I had also visited a
clergyman and a barrister with whom I had a slight acquaintance; it was waste
power, time thrown away, and I must have paid the visits without the least hope
of deriving any good from them.</p>

<p>As I walked towards my home I was overcome with faintness, and I reeled like
a drunken man. Then I recollected that food had not passed my lips since
breakfast yesterday morning. I entered the nearest restaurant—it happened to be
a public-house—and standing at the counter ate some sandwiches and hard boiled
eggs. The barmaid asked what I would take to drink and for a moment I thought of
calling for brandy, but it was not on that occasion I broke my vow never to
touch spirituous liquor. I drank a glass of lemonade, and pursued my homeward
way.</p>

<p>As I entered the house I heard Barbara moaning and gibbering upstairs. The
sounds were familiar to me, and it was with a sickening feeling that I entered
the sitting-room. Maxwell was there and my stepmother. Maxwell was quite
composed; my stepmother looked rather scared at my sudden entrance and wild
appearance. They did not welcome me with effusion. Maxwell made the remark that
they had been wondering what had become of me, and he inquired why I had not
come home last night. I did not answer him. My stepmother volunteered the
information that poor Barbara was very ill.</p>

<p>&quot;You had better not go up to her,&quot; she said. &quot;The sight of you will make her
worse.&quot;</p>

<p>Neither did I reply to her. Their presence was so hateful to me that I left
the room unceremoniously. They followed me into the passage, and, my foot on the
stairs, some words of what passed between them reached my ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Mad, I think,&quot; said my stepmother.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks remarkably like it,&quot; responded Maxwell, pulling at his mustache. &quot;Or,
let us be charitable, and put it down to drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Supposing,&quot; she said, and finished the sentence in a whisper.</p>

<p>I stepped back.</p>

<p>&quot;Supposing you drove me mad between you,&quot; I said, &quot;there would be an end of
me, and you and my wife would have control of my property. Is that it, dear
friends?&quot;</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and my stepmother said, boldly: &quot;Decidedly mad.
Not a doubt of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear stepmother,&quot; I said, my voice and manner expressing detestation of
her, &quot;not yet mad. Sane as yourselves. You remind me of an omission which I must
repair. I have not made my will; it is a thing that ought not to be neglected.
Not one of you shall profit by it, I promise you. Pray let me know what you are
in my house for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are here to protect my sister from your brutality,&quot; said Maxwell, and it
pleased me to see that I had disconcerted them.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed! From my brutality? Of which you have already given evidence in your
secret court of inquiry. And your sister, too. There was a time when I fancied
there was no great love on either side. You pair of scheming devils! I will show
you that I am master here. Out! the pair of you! Out of my house!&quot; And I
advanced towards them with so threatening an air that they began to retreat.</p>

<p>&quot;We will see what the law says to this,&quot; blustered Maxwell. &quot;We have
witnesses enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;False witnesses—false testimony. When you come to consider the matter it may
not suit your purpose to appeal to the law. Establish that my wife lives in fear
of me, and that I am systematically cruel to her, and you will succeed in
obtaining a judicial separation. I shall not thwart you, for it is what I pray
for. The Courts award her maintenance, the income of a third of what I am worth.
Then I am free, and you and she can trouble me no more. Free! Can you understand
what that means to me? Fools! I have offered her more than a third, and she has
refused. Why, if I gave her cause for a complete divorce she would not avail
herself of it. She is too good a wife, too pure, too mindful of her wifely
duties to desert the husband she loves so well.&quot;</p>

<p>Had it not been that I was apprehensive of falling into deeper public
disgrace I should not have spoken so openly, for it was speaking against my own
interests; but, indeed, I might have spared myself this small duplicity, for
nothing was farther from their wishes than to sever the bonds which bound me to
Barbara. While those held firm they had, through her, some power over my purse;
loosen them, and the power was gone. It was only through my enforced bondage
that they could hope to gain.</p>

<p>&quot;When you were a child,&quot; said my stepmother, white to the lips, &quot;I foresaw
what you would grow into.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did your best for me,&quot; I retorted. &quot;You made my home a paradise—not much
worse than this home is to me—you showed me daily how you loved me. I remember
well your tender care of me. Truly there are men and women who are baser than
beasts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I were a man I would thrash you,&quot; she hissed.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask your son Louis, my loving half-brother, to do it for you. Ask that
reptile by your side to undertake the task. Cunning and malice have had their
day. Let us try brute force.&quot;</p>

<p>I laughed in their faces. In this encounter we were more like animals
snarling at one another than human beings. Meanwhile Barbara continued her
moaning and gibbering upstairs.</p>

<p>&quot;That is my work, is it not?&quot; I went on. &quot;It is I who have made her what she
is, a living shame to decency. Before our marriage she never touched strong
drink—is that the way it goes? She was an innocent, simple child of nature, and
it is I who have debased and contaminated her. That is what you have made my
friends believe. If it is any satisfaction to you, hear from my lips that your
cowardly plot has succeeded, and that the honorable career I had mapped out for
myself is at an end. Has my wife told you that on the first night of our
marriage she locked herself in her room in Paris and drank herself into such a
filthy state of intoxication that we were turned out of our hotel? But doubtless
she kept this delectable piece of information to herself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another of your abominable inventions,&quot; cried my stepmother, &quot;as true as all
the rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly. As true as all the rest. Women such as she, and you, should be
whipped daily for the public good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried my stepmother, digging her nails into her palms. If she could
have killed me with a look she would have done it—and with shame I admit that I
should have deserved a greater punishment than that for expressing myself as I
did. But I was stung to utter recklessness, to utter forgetfulness of what was
due to one&#39;s own sense of self-respect.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, John,&quot; said Maxwell, trying another tack, &quot;you are over-excited.
You will be sorry for this to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry for it to-day. It was not to be expected when I courted your
sister that you should warn me of the pit into which I was falling—you were too
anxious to be rid of her. I see now, but did not see then, the meaning of your
covert sneers when you spoke of our married life. By the way, from time to time
you borrowed money of me in those days. Are you prepared to repay it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What I owe you,&quot; he replied, with a dark look, &quot;I will repay—with interest.
As for money, I never had one farthing from you.&quot; He turned to my stepmother.
&quot;He is good at invention, this John of ours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is good at anything low and vile,&quot; she said. &quot;Mark my words—one of these
days he will commit murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You nurse your hatred well,&quot; I responded. &quot;And now, quit my house.&quot;</p>

<p>They retreated before me, and I drove them, as though they were cattle, to
the street door.</p>

<p>&quot;John,&quot; said Maxwell, with a sudden show of amiability, &quot;this is all
nonsense, you know. Let us be friends.&quot;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and the impulse was upon me to strike it down, but I
merely gave him a contemptuous look, and threw open the street door. As they
stood on the threshold Louis came up, and I think for a moment that Maxwell,
with this reinforcement, had an idea of forcing his way in again.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see what he is doing?&quot; cried my stepmother to her son. &quot;The low
wretch is turning us out of the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What else can you expect?&quot; asked Louis, the scar on his forehead becoming
blood-red in my frowning glance.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall come back,&quot; said Maxwell, and I slammed the door in his face.</p>

<p>My conduct was brutal; I admit it. It would have been manlier had I behaved
with dignity, but during that evil time all my impulses were evil. There is an
element of savagery in every human being, and it leaped forth and mastered me,
and robbed sorrow of its crown. It led me into further excesses, and had not an
angel appeared and rescued me, I might have deserved all the obloquy that had
been thrown upon me, and have become utterly, irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>It was evening, and I lingered in the passage outside Barbara&#39;s door, which
was locked against me. Then I called aloud:</p>

<p>&quot;Annette, are you there?&quot;</p>

<p>At first no answer; then, the question repeated, the reply:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Open the door.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, monsieur, it is madame&#39;s orders,&quot; she began, but I did not allow her to
finish.</p>

<p>&quot;Open the door.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dare not disobey madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Open the door.&quot;</p>

<p>This time she did not answer. I put my shoulder to the door, and exerted all
my strength. It is not a thing to boast of that I am a man of great muscular
power, and that on this occasion I exulted in it. The evil spirit within me
urged me on. As I strained my muscles there was silence in the room; for a
little while Barbara&#39;s voice was not heard. The door creaked, yielded, then
burst open with a crash.</p>

<p>Annette stood upright, her cold, gray eyes fixed upon me. She was a woman of
indomitable firmness, and in my knowledge of her she never showed the least
trace of fear. My wife cowered on the floor, clad only in her nightdress, and in
a more disgraceful condition than when I found her lying at the door of my
chambers in the Strand. Her body was trembling and convulsed, her features
twitched, there was a nameless terror in her eyes. The atmosphere of the
apartment reeked with the fumes of liquor.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a faithful servant,&quot; I said to Annette, &quot;to encourage your mistress
in these disgusting orgies. You have a human excuse, I suppose. It pays you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am paid with ingratitude,&quot; she answered, composedly. &quot;To keep
this&quot;—pointing to my wife—&quot;from the other servants in the house—is not that
faithful service?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to give false evidence against your master,&quot; I retorted, &quot;that also is
faithful service, is it not? I know you for what you are, Annette—a panderer to
vice and infamy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is defamation, monsieur, I can make you pay for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do so. It will rid me of you. I am willing to pay the price.&quot;</p>

<p>This bickering was stopped by a piercing scream from Barbara.</p>

<p>&quot;See there—see there!&quot; the wretched creature shrieked. &quot;Those devils are
creeping in again! Keep them off—keep them off! Save me—save me!&quot;</p>

<p>She bit, she snarled, she tore at the phantoms.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the scene. My pen halts, my fingers refuse to trace the
words. I remember helping Annette to lift my wife to the bed; I remember noting
with morbid curiosity the singular phase in her delirium that she clung to
Annette for protection while she clawed at me; I remember her falling from the
bed, and creeping under it to hide herself from the imaginary terrors which
afflict the dipsomaniac; I recall her delirious entreaties for more brandy, her
shrieks for mercy, her ribald utterances when, for a brief space, these terrors
ceased, her shuddering paroxysms, her tears, her hysterical sobs. Good God! Can
we call such beings human? Should there not be a law to put them under
restraint, to treat them as we treat the mad, to free the innocent partners of
their unspeakable degradation from the horrible curse which weighs like a blight
upon despairing hearts?</p>

<p>So the night passed, and I paced the passages, the rooms, the stairs, in a
frame of mind the memory of which even now, after a lapse of years, sends a
shudder through me. For the time being I lost faith in human goodness. Purity
and sweetness were delusions—they had no existence. Charity, virtue, kindliness,
our holiest sentiments, the spiritual instinct which lifts our thoughts above
sordid cares and rewards, all were mockeries, and he who believed in them was a
fool. Nothing was real but corruption. Beneath the lying mask on the world&#39;s
face lurked treachery and foul desire, and over this mass of impurity reigned
the Spirit of Evil.</p>


<p>At the end of the succeeding week I broke the vow I had made never to touch
spirituous liquor. To my shame be it recorded.</p>

<p>I had eaten scarcely anything the previous two days, and was suffering from
terrible depression. It was while I was in this state, pacing the dining-room,
up and down, up and down, with nerves so sensitively attuned that any sudden
noise made me start, that my eyes fell upon a bottle of brandy which had just
been uncorked, and inadvertently left upon the sideboard. It fascinated me. I
turned from it, was drawn to it again, and for several minutes gazed fixedly at
it. Here was rest, here was forgetfulness, here was at least a transient relief.
An enticing devil lurked in that bottle, inviting me, tempting me, luring me on.
I laid my hand upon it.</p>

<p>My conscience smote me, but my moral strength was sapped. Character,
reputation, happiness, all were lost. Let the last remnants of self-respect go
with them. In all the wide world there was not one man or woman who cared what
became of me, not one human being who entertained for me a spark of affection.
Whether I died the death of a dog or a martyr would not affect the judgment
which had been passed upon me. My epitaph was already written, and nothing could
alter it. The fiend Insomnia held me in his grip. During the past week I had not
had two consecutive hours&#39; sleep. To save myself from going mad I must have a
few hours&#39; oblivion from the misery which encompassed me.</p>

<p>I poured the liquor into a tumbler, and drank it neat. It burnt my throat,
but almost immediately I was conscious of a riotous revulsion of spirits. Again
and again I drank, forcing the liquor down my throat till the bottle was empty,
when I must have fallen to the ground in a drunken stupor. I recall that it was
broad daylight when I yielded to the temptation, and put the final touch to my
sorrows by this act of self-degradation.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession16" href="#ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">When I awoke all was dark. My throat was parched, there was a
horrible racking pain in my head, a nauseating faintness at my heart. But worse
than this was the torment of remorse which weighed me down. I had placed myself
on a level with my curse, had proved myself worthy of it. There was no excuse
for the shameful excess in which I had indulged. A hypocrite, self-convicted, I
had become a willing slave to the vice I had condemned, and I could now take
rank with the abandoned creatures from whom I had shrank in horror.</p>

<p>With difficulty I rose from the floor, upsetting furniture in the effort, and
felt my way to my bedroom, where I plunged my head into a basin of cold water,
keeping it there for some time, and sucking in the water like a dog. As I stood
dripping, in the darkness, I heard a kind of sing-song proceeding from Barbara&#39;s
room. Stealing into the passage, I listened to the drivel. &quot;Beast John is
drunk—dead, dead drunk! He preaches, preaches, preaches—Oh, the good man!
Maxwell knows, his mother knows, Louis knows. Ha, ha, ha! How funny! Beast John
is drunk—dead, dead drunk! Now let him preach—now let him write to the papers.&quot;
There was no method in her singing, no rythmical arrangement of the insane song.
The words dropped from her lips in disjointed fashion, and there was a taunting
exultation in her utterance of them.</p>

<p>A frightful temptation assailed me—to kill her and myself, and be done with
the world. &quot;What matter?&quot; I muttered. &quot;There is no God! If there were He would
not permit such women to live.&quot; Even at this distance of time—yes, even though I
know that my days are numbered—I am thankful that some mysterious force within
me leaped up to fight the demon that would have damned my soul. I was conscious
of the inward conflict, the conflict of the two spirits, the good and the evil,
which are said to be forever warring for supremacy in a man&#39;s heart. I hope I
may say now (though I did not believe so then) that my suffering had not crushed
all the good out of me, and that there was still some vitality in the better
impulses of my being. I did not openly recant the impious words I had muttered;
my mood was too sullen for that. I was ready for sin, but not for crime. My life
was mine, and I could do with it as I pleased, but it was not within my right to
dispose of the life of another mortal. Brooding upon this I fled from the house
as from a pestilence.</p>

<p>Intent upon self-destruction, I bent my steps riverwards. It was a wretched
night. Rain was falling heavily, and there was no light in the sky. The spirit
of black death brooded over the city. It was as if nature favored my sinful
purpose—or so I chose to interpret the signs.</p>

<p>There were but few persons about; I took no notice of them, nor they of me.
Small incidents became unduly magnified. I had walked some three or four miles,
and was in the immediate vicinity of Westminster Abbey when the cathedral clock
began to strike. I paused and listened with extreme attention, standing quite
motionless and counting the strokes till the hour was fully announced. It
appeared to me a singular and unusual thing that it should be three o&#39;clock;
singular, also, that the rain should have ceased, and that a fog was creeping
over the streets.</p>

<p>It was only when I was again in motion that the significance of time, in
relation to the purpose I had in view, impressed me. &quot;Three o&#39;clock,&quot; I thought.
&quot;At four I shall be dead.&quot; Crossing the road at the top of Parliament Street a
man, passing hastily, stumbled against me. In a spirit of fury I grappled and
threw him to the ground—and stood over him, ready to stamp on him if he showed
resistance. All my senses were alert for evil. The man did not stir, and I
passed on. But I had not proceeded far before I stopped to consider whether I
had killed him. I groped my way back to the spot upon which I had left him. The
man was gone. I was neither glad nor sorry.</p>

<p>A woman—one of the misery&#39;s children—accosted me; appealed to me, for the
love of God, to give her a penny for a cup of coffee. The coffee stall, which I
had not seen, was within a dozen yards of us; its lights shone dim through the
fog, and shadowy, ghost-like forms hung about it. I gave the woman a shilling,
and continued on my way. I was now on Westminster Bridge. The fog was
thickening. I could scarcely see the water. The dull reflection of the lamps on
the Embankment added to the general despondency of the scene. I was enwrapped in
gloom and silence. I walked to the end of the bridge, and stood on the steps
leading down to the river.</p>

<p>Upon what a slight foundation rests a man&#39;s fate! A chance turning this way
or that, a moment&#39;s hesitation, may make or mar, may lead to destruction or
salvation. I heard the muffled tread of a policeman, and fearing that I had been
seen, and my purpose discovered, I did not descend the steps, but crossing the
road, walked slowly towards Kennington, intending presently to return and carry
out my sinful design. The probability is that I had not been seen, and should
not have been interrupted, for the policeman did not follow me, and the echo of
his footsteps gradually died away. When I was assured of this I should have
turned again towards the river had not a simple incident changed the whole
current of my life. The sound of a woman&#39;s suppressed sobs fell upon my ear.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession17" href="#ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">She was standing at the door of a chemist&#39;s shop, endeavoring to
arouse the proprietor by repeated pulling of the night bell, pausing between
each summons, and vainly endeavoring to choke back her tears. I could not see
her face, but so keen and poignant was her grief that I should have been less
than human had I passed by without a word. The note of suffering in her voice
touched a sympathetic chord in my heart, and awoke the dormant sense of good
within me.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you crying for?&quot; I inquired, stepping to her side.</p>

<p>My question seemed to terrify her, and she made a movement as if about to
fly. But the duty upon which she was bent gave her courage.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t speak to me!&quot; she implored. &quot;For heaven&#39;s sake, leave me!&quot;</p>

<p>I knew what she intended to convey by this appeal. She mistook me for one of
the human ghouls who prowl the streets in the belief that every woman is frail.</p>

<p>&quot;I will not harm you,&quot; I said, and I repeated my question. &quot;What are you
crying for?&quot;</p>

<p>My sad voice reassured her—so she subsequently informed me—and after a pause
she answered timidly. &quot;I have been trying for a quarter of an hour to make the
chemist hear, but he will not come down. It is life or death, and he will not
come down!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your life or death?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, &quot;not mine; my mother&#39;s—my dear mother&#39;s!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see what I can do,&quot; I said, and I pulled the bell, and listened, with
my ear close to the door.</p>

<p>There was no response, and I pulled again, and failed to hear the ring. I
discovered then that the night bell was broken. There was another bell on the
other side of the door, and this I pulled vigorously, and beat on the door with
my fist.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter with your mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is very ill—she has been ill for months. Are you a doctor, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. What does the doctor who is attending her say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have none, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why? Surely in a matter of life or death one is necessary.&quot; I continued
to ring and beat on the door.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, I know,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Oh, will he never come?&quot;</p>

<p>I gathered from this mournful reply that they were poor and could not afford
a doctor, which was presently confirmed. My vigorous summons was successful in
arousing the chemist, who, with a sleepy and unwilling air, opened the door and
admitted us. Now, by the light in the shop, I saw that the woman was young,
hardly yet out of her teens, and though grief was stamped too plainly upon her
countenance, that she was fair and prepossessing. So modest and gentle was she
that I was filled with pity for her. Her eyes were dim with tears, her hair had
become loosened and hung in lovely disorder upon her white neck, her features
bore traces of exhausting vigil. With a trembling hand she held out a
prescription, saying in a wistful tone:</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry to disturb you, but my mother is much worse to-night. I will pay
you to-morrow—I have some work to take back.&quot;</p>

<p>He grumbled a little and hesitated, and I, stepping back so that the young
woman could not see my action, nodded to him and held up my purse. Understanding
from this that I intended to pay him he made up the medicine and gave her the
bottle, with which, after expressing her gratitude, she was about to depart,
when I said to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Will you wait for me a moment at the door? You may trust me.&quot;</p>

<p>The sincerity I felt must have made itself manifest in my voice, for she bent
her head slightly, and waited for me outside.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter with her mother?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot say,&quot; replied the chemist. &quot;She has been ill a long time and ought
to have a doctor. This is an old prescription; I have made it up several times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I right in supposing that they cannot afford &#39;a doctor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is evident. They are very poor. They owe me for three bottles already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She appears to be respectable,&quot; I said, as I paid him what was due.</p>

<p>&quot;No doubt of it. She works day and night, and I should say it is as much as
she can do to keep body and soul together.&quot;</p>

<p>At my request he wrote the address of a doctor in the neighborhood, and
instructed me how to find him. Then I joined the young woman.</p>

<p>&quot;You must accept my escort,&quot; I said. &quot;It is hardly safe for you to be out on
such a night. I am sincerely sorry for your trouble. I may be able to lighten
it.&quot;</p>

<p>She trembled so violently that I feared she would fall, but she did not
accept my arm. We walked side by side, in silence, till we reached one of the
poorest houses in one of the poorest streets. There she stopped, and wished me
good night, and thanked me for my services.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to fetch a doctor to your mother,&quot; I said. &quot;How shall we obtain
admittance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid I must refuse, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;We are not in a position to pay
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave that to me,&quot; I replied. &quot;When one dear to you is in peril you cannot
refuse to accept assistance even from a stranger. I can sympathize with honest
pride, but surely this would be carrying it too far. Your mother needs a doctor.
She shall see one.&quot; I looked up at the windows, and in one at the top of the
house I could faintly distinguish a glimmer of light. &quot;Is that your room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I knock or ring when I come back with the doctor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you will give a gentle knock, so as not to disturb the other lodgers, I
will come down.&quot; Then, after a momentary pause, &quot;I did not believe there was
such goodness in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You overrate my services. If you knew what you have saved me from——&quot; I did
not finish, but asked her to give me the name of the street and the number of
the house, which she did. &quot;And your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cameron, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. The trust you repose in me shall not be abused.&quot;</p>

<p>I waited till she had let herself in with a latch-key, and then I departed on
my errand.</p>

<p>By this time the fog was so thick that I doubt whether I should have found
the street to which I had been directed had it not been for the assistance of a
policeman, who accompanied me to the doctor&#39;s house. The doctor himself answered
my summons, an elderly gentleman, with a careworn, benignant face, who, when he
learned what was required of him, said he would come with me at once. We
conversed on the way, and he informed me that he had some knowledge of the
Camerons, who had called him two or three months ago to prescribe for the
mother. They were respectable people, he told me, who had, like numbers of
others in the locality, a hard fight to keep the wolf from the door. They
belonged to the class who slaved and suffered patiently and silently; everybody
spoke well of them, and the daughter was specially modest and gentle in her
manners. Except that they appeared to be superior in point of conduct and
education, to their neighbors, he knew nothing more of them. He was surprised,
the mother being so ill, that the daughter had not come to him; but yet, on
second thoughts, he was not surprised, their peculiar delicacy in money matters
stopping the way. It was often so with the poor, who were hyper-sensitive in
their pride.</p>

<p>I then explained what it was I wished him to do—to attend to the sick woman
regularly, and to prescribe what was necessary in the shape of food and
medicine. He was to relieve their minds in respect of his fees, which, with all
other expenses, I would pay. In token of my sincerity and ability to carry out
my desire I begged him to accept a couple of sovereigns in advance, to which he
very willingly consented.</p>

<p>&quot;My patients are not quite regular in their payments,&quot; he said in a gentle
tone, &quot;and it is not in my nature to press them. So far as gratitude goes, I am
richly repaid. You are, perhaps, a relative of the Camerons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not in any way related to them,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;A friend of long standing, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never seen the mother, and scarcely an hour ago I saw Miss Cameron
for the first time—by chance,&quot; I added.</p>

<p>&quot;A singular hour,&quot; he observed, &quot;and a strange night for a chance meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes—but so it happened.&quot; And I related how it came about, saying nothing of
myself or of the circumstances which caused me to be perambulating the streets
at such a time.</p>

<p>He was silent for a little while, and I fancied I heard him sigh. Then he
said, &quot;You are a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I may lay claim to the title.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In station, by which I mean worldly circumstances, far above the Camerons—at
least, so I judge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are poor and lowly. Miss Cameron is young, and not unattractive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand you. My motives are open to suspicion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it not natural?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite, and I do not blame you for doubting me, but you must not do Miss
Cameron an injustice. She is absolutely blameless. I have related the simple
truth, and were you acquainted with my story—which I do not consider myself free
to disclose—your doubts would vanish. Can you not credit me with a sincere
desire to serve two poor and deserving persons without harboring a base thought
towards them?&quot;</p>

<p>As my sad voice had won Miss Cameron&#39;s confidence, so it now won the
confidence of the good doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a censorious world,&quot; he said, &quot;and I spoke out of its mouth. Forgive
me.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Cameron must have been keeping watch for us, for my soft tap on the
street door was almost immediately answered. Standing in the passage, her hand
shading the candle from the night air, she seemed to hesitate whether to invite
me in, and I, divining—which was the case—that she and her mother occupied but
one room, resolved the difficulty by saying, &quot;I will see you bye and bye,
doctor,&quot; and pulling the street door to.</p>

<p>Left alone in the dark street, I fell to musing upon the events of the last
twenty-four hours. I could scarcely see a dozen yards before me, and even at
that distance a moving form would have presented the semblance of a shadow
created by the spreading fog; not a sound but that of my own footsteps disturbed
the stillness of the dreary scene. And yet, dismal as were my surroundings, I
was conscious that my spirits had assumed a more healthy tone. I was devoutly
grateful for the change that had come over me, and I did not stop to consider
whether it was due to chance or to a merciful interposition of Providence at the
most critical period in my life. A heavy weight was lifted from my heart. I had
been saved by a woman&#39;s face, a woman&#39;s voice; she had set free the sealed
springs of sympathy and pity—I once was more human.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me. The brief interview with Miss Cameron, the few words
we had exchanged, had not inspired me with love for her—that was in the future,
and to be reared upon a more reasonable foundation; but it had revealed to me
that there was still some worthy work for me to do, that having sinned through
self-indulgence in a vice I abhorred, and having contemplated a deed the thought
of which now sent a shudder through me, I might work out my redemption by simple
acts of kindness to beings even more forlorn than myself.</p>

<p>No, it was not love I felt, but deep gratitude that an example of
self-sacrifice and devotion should have crushed forever out of me the impious
doubt of the existence of a beneficent Creator. It was to this I owed my
salvation, and as I paced the foggy street I thought of the daughter toiling for
her sick mother. I saw her patient face of suffering, heard her wistful voice
saying: &quot;I will pay you to-morrow; I have some work to take back.&quot; Ah, what a
story is here revealed! I dwelt upon the modesty which caused her to shrink from
the compassionate advances of a stranger, and with tears in my eyes dwelt also
upon the child-like confidence she had reposed in me. She became to me an
incarnation of purity. There were good women in the world—thank God for that.
Through her spirit my faith in human goodness was restored, and I saw my life in
a clearer light, unstained and unclouded by vice and degradation. Peace, if not
happiness, might yet be mine.</p>

<p>To one course I pledged myself, and vowed that nothing should turn me from
it. I would never live with my wife again; her revolting duplicities, her
shameful debasement, should no longer torture me. I would be done with her, so
far as personal association went, and with those other relatives who had
systematically persecuted me and maligned me. The infamous law—wickedly and
falsely called the law of God—which bound me to a living curse, to a moral pest,
could not compel me to inhabit the house in which she indulged in her
depravities. Of so much of my fortune as was left she should have a share, and
should receive it through an agent. One visit only would I pay to what was in
mockery called my home, and that for the purpose of removing my private papers.
Then would I shake the dust of that earthly hell from my feet, and turn my back
upon it forever.</p>

<p>To this end I must efface myself, and must be known henceforth by another
name than Fordham. That was easy, and I was stung by no reproach as to
justification. If ever a man was justified in practising such a deceit it was I.</p>

<p>My musings were interrupted by the unclosing of the street door. The doctor
was there, and Miss Cameron; he was bidding her take some repose.</p>

<p>&quot;We must not have you break down,&quot; he said. &quot;Ah, here is our friend. The fog
has not swallowed him up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can I thank you?&quot; she said to me, holding out her hand. It trembled as
it lay for a moment in mine, and her eyes shone with tears.</p>

<p>&quot;By following the doctor&#39;s advice,&quot; I replied, &quot;and by allowing me to call
when I have had some rest myself. Your mother is no worse, I hope?&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor—one of those sensible practitioners who help their patients to get
well by bright words—answered for her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not worse, not at all, not at all. With heaven&#39;s help we&#39;ll set her up
again. There, there, my dear, don&#39;t cry; and what are you about, stopping here
in the cold? Go and lie down. I will send the medicine at nine o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p>As we walked away together he said: &quot;It would be cruel to tell her the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then there is no hope?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>It seemed to me as if in those few words he had pronounced a sentence of
death, and as if I were about to sustain a personal loss.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, there is hope,&quot; he replied; &quot;but for poor people the gates are
closed.&quot;</p>

<p>I begged him to explain, and he did so. Mrs. Cameron was suffering not only
from debility, brought on by want of nourishing food, but from a chest and
throat complaint which would certainly result fatally if she remained in London.
The pestilential air, the poisonous fog—they spelt death. She could not possibly
live through the coming winter. She needed a purer air, wine, and better food,
and these were out of her reach. By slaving day and night at her needle the
mother and daughter earned eight or nine shillings a week. They had no rich
friends. What could they do?</p>

<p>&quot;It is a question of money?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is a question of money, though even then I do not say she will
recover. The privations she has endured have made terrible inroads upon her
constitution.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there would be a chance of recovery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly a chance of recovery. In fact, the only chance. It is painful to
witness such cases, to stand by a bedside and see a life passing away which
money would probably save; but there is no help for it. The poor girl will
suffer terribly. I have seldom witnessed such love, such devotion. It is
surprising how she keeps up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is help for it, doctor,&quot; I said, &quot;and I should like to see you
to-morrow to speak about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am home for consultations till twelve. May I ask your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fletcher,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>Thus was the first stone in my self-banishment laid.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession18" href="#ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">I passed the next few hours in a common lodging-house, and laid
down on a bed without undressing. I dozed, but did not sleep, my mind being
occupied in formulating a plan with regard to the Camerons. I rose at nine
o&#39;clock, washed, and had breakfast, and then went in search of apartments in a
respectable house. I had little difficulty in finding what I required—three
furnished rooms in a street inhabited by a decent class of people. The landlady
murmured something about a reference, but I satisfied her with a month&#39;s payment
in advance. The rent was moderate, and I arranged for breakfast, and the
occasional cooking of a dinner if I desired. I gave, of course, the same name,
Fletcher, retaining my Christian name. So I began my new life as John Fletcher.</p>

<p>At twelve o&#39;clock I presented myself to the worthy doctor, and unfolded my
plan. It was nothing less than the removal of Mrs. and Miss Cameron to Swanage,
the climate of which place the doctor said would suit the invalid. I proposed
that I should go down to Swanage to arrange where they were to stay, and that
they should get out of London before the end of the week.</p>

<p>&quot;All this will cost a great deal of money,&quot; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;Not so very much. They can live—perhaps in a farmhouse—for two or three
pounds a week. I can afford it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know what it means to them? They will look upon it as a fairy tale,
and will be afraid of waking up and finding it a dream.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you see, it is no dream, and it is nonsense to talk of fairy tales. It is
plain common sense. They will need warm clothing. Give them this—it will come
better from you. I daresay there will be sufficient left to pay their fares
down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you intend to accompany them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I shall remain in London; but there must necessarily be some
correspondence between us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And still—pray don&#39;t be angry—I am puzzled and curious as to your motive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me put it to you in this way, doctor. You see now and then in the papers
an acknowledgment from the Chancellor of the Exchequer of a parcel of bank notes
from X. Y. Z., for unpaid income tax. It is called conscience money. The
difference is that I have wronged neither man nor woman, yet what I am doing is
an affair of the conscience. Will not this content you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must.&quot; Then after a pause, &quot;You have seen trouble?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Few men have had harder trials, bitterer disappointments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I regret to hear it. And now, who is to acquaint the Camerons with your
scheme?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I decline. I will give them the money you have entrusted with me, and I will
make Miss Cameron understand that it is imperatively necessary that her mother
be removed without delay. The rest is in your hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well—though I should prefer it otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am going now to see my patient, and I will prepare them for this change in
their fortunes. You will probably see Miss Cameron in the course of the
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kindly tell her I will call at two o&#39;clock. I shall leave for Swanage by the
five o&#39;clock train.&quot;</p>

<p>I make but brief reference to my interview with Miss Cameron. She was
profoundly grateful for the services I was rendering them, but seemed, indeed,
as the doctor had said, to fear that it was a dream from which she would
presently awake, though the small sum of money I had sent her by the doctor&#39;s
hands should have convinced her. I did not see her mother, our interview taking
place in a lower room in the house, which the landlady placed at her disposal.
It was difficult for her to understand why a stranger should step forward to
befriend her, and my lame attempts at an explanation did not assist her to a
better understanding of the matter.</p>

<p>Seeing her now in the daylight the impression I had formed of her was
confirmed. Her features, without being handsome, were full of sensibility, and
there was a pleasing refinement in her language and manners. What most attracted
me in her were her eyes. Truth and resignation, and the strength which springs
from a reliance upon the goodness of God, dwelt in their clear depths, and now,
illumined by hope, they instilled in me a faith in her which from that hour has
not been shaken. The faith she had in me touched me deeply. In contrast with the
women it had been my ill-fortune to mix with she was an angel from heaven.</p>

<p>&quot;You will hear from me in a day or two,&quot; I said. &quot;Will your mother be strong
enough to travel then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The doctor says she will,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you money enough to provide what is necessary for your journey?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More than enough,&quot; she said, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>I had to tear myself away.</p>

<p>The journey down to Swanage was one of the happiest I had ever taken; I had
an object in life, and there was seldom absent from my thoughts the light of
hope that shone in Miss Cameron&#39;s eyes. Suitable accommodation for her and her
mother was easily obtained in a farmhouse near to the sea. The terms were
exceedingly moderate, and in a letter to Miss Cameron, I bade her get ready, and
requested her to meet me at the doctor&#39;s house on the following day. Then, for
the first time, I signed myself, &quot;John Fletcher.&quot;</p>

<p>At the appointed hour I met Miss Cameron, and giving her written particulars
of the place I had taken for her, and instructions as to trains, I bade her
good-bye and God-speed. I had debated whether I should accompany them to the
railway station, and had decided not to do so. They were accustomed to look
after themselves, and my presence would embarrass them, and add to their sense
of obligation.</p>

<p>&quot;Write to me as soon as you are settled,&quot; I said, &quot;and let me know whether
you are comfortable. If you are not, we will soon find another place for you.
And mind, you are going down for your mother&#39;s health, and you are not to worry.
Leave everything to me.&quot;</p>

<p>I pressed an envelope into her hand, and to cut short her thanks, hastily
took my departure.</p>

<p>I had now plenty to occupy me. My first visit was to a solicitor, to entrust
him with the execution of the plan I had laid down with respect to my
wife—before doing which I had devoted some time to a careful survey of my
pecuniary position. There had been much waste and extravagance on Barbara&#39;s
part, and my little fortune had dwindled. I decided to allow her £300 a year,
quite sufficient for her to live upon in comfort. That I should have to encroach
upon my capital for the payment of this sum and for my own expenses did not
cause me anxiety. I did not go beyond the next few years in my calculations;
meanwhile I might be able to earn money. Whatever was my income, Barbara should
have an equal share of it; she could not reasonably ask for more, having only
herself to support. If a court of law were called upon to decide the matter she
would probably have less. Upon £300 a year the house in Kensington could not be
kept up, and I determined that it should be sold. All household debts contracted
to date were to be discharged, and so much of the furniture as Barbara would not
need in her new quarters was to be disposed of by auction. The solicitor
undertook the management of this troublesome business, and I bound him down to
absolute secrecy. Upon no consideration whatever was the slightest clue to my
movements, and to the name I had assumed to be given to inquirers. I left him to
prepare the necessary documents, and proceeded to my house, armed with written
discharges of the servants in my employ. A cab I had engaged stood at the door,
and a porter accompanied me into the house.</p>

<p>All the evil crew were there—Maxwell, my stepmother, Louis and Barbara. Her
bloated face filled me with loathing. She gave me a sullen look.</p>

<p>&quot;The prodigal son has returned,&quot; said Maxwell. &quot;Where&#39;s the veal?&quot;</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and the parlor-maid entered the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Send all the servants up,&quot; I said to the girl, &quot;and tell that woman,
Annette, I wish to see her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want the servants for?&quot; demanded Barbara.</p>

<p>&quot;You will see.&quot;</p>

<p>I heard them in the passage, and I opened the door for them, Annette coming
in last.</p>

<p>&quot;You sent for me madame?&quot; she said in her smooth voice, gliding with catlike
motion to Barbara&#39;s chair.</p>

<p>&quot;I sent for you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;At your service, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is like a scene in a drama,&quot; said Maxwell, with an attempt at jocularity.
&quot;Get to the action, John.&quot;</p>

<p>I handed the women their written notices of discharge, and gave them to
understand that after the expiration of their month I would be no longer
responsible for their wages.</p>

<p>&quot;Take no notice of him,&quot; said Barbara, flushing up. &quot;He is out of his
senses.&quot;</p>

<p>With a nod she dismissed them, and they trooped out.</p>

<p>I turned to Annette and held out the discharge. She refused to take it, and
it fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;I am in madame&#39;s service, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is her affair and yours. You are not in mine. I discharge you. Your
next month&#39;s wages will be paid, after which you will not receive another
shilling from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon what grounds am I discharged, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not discharged, Annette,&quot; exclaimed Barbara.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, madame. I take it only from you. I asked monsieur a question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon the grounds of treachery and unfaithfulness,&quot; I said, calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;You hear,&quot; she said, appealing to the others. &quot;It is slander. You are
witnesses. It is not the first time—no, it is not the first time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our law courts are open to you,&quot; I said. &quot;Try them, and see what an English
judge will say to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is perhaps right,&quot; she remarked, with a sly glance at the decanter of
brandy on the table. &quot;Monsieur is not in his senses.&quot; Her voice was as smooth as
if she were paying me compliments, and her manner was entirely unruffled.</p>

<p>At this point Barbara started up in a fit of passion. &quot;You monster!&quot; she
screamed, and would have thrown herself upon me had not Maxwell held her back.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold hard, Barbara,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us see the end of it. Don&#39;t spoil the
drama. It is really a very good drama, John.&quot;</p>

<p>I went up to my bedroom, and rapidly packing my bag, called to the porter to
take it to the cab. Then I re-entered the parlor.</p>

<p>&quot;One last word,&quot; I said to Barbara. &quot;In the presence of your friends I take
my leave of you. This house will be sold soon, and you will have to reside
elsewhere. My solicitor will write to you presently, and will make you
acquainted with the arrangements I have decided upon. It is my fervent hope that
we shall never meet again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By God, he is in earnest!&quot; cried Maxwell.</p>

<p>As I left the room I saw Barbara staring at me with parted lips, and Maxwell,
my stepmother, and Louis looking blankly at each other. Annette was smiling
quietly, and playing with her cap strings.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession19" href="#ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">On the following day I received a letter from Miss Cameron. They
were very comfortable, the place was beautiful, the air delightful, her mother
seemed to be better already. She signed herself Ellen Cameron, and hereafter I
thought of her only as Ellen. It was not such a letter as an ordinary
needlewoman would have written. The writing was that of a lady, and the wording
appropriate and well-chosen. The signs of fair culture in it were very pleasing
to me.</p>

<p>I did not reply to it immediately, thinking it unbecoming to show haste. In a
day or two I wrote, expressing satisfaction at the report, and bidding her take
advantage of every hour of fine weather. Acting upon the doctor&#39;s suggestion, I
dispatched a hamper of fruit, wine, and jelly, and continued to do so at regular
intervals. Ellen&#39;s thanks for these gifts were extravagant, and rather
humiliated me. If thanks were due to either of us, it was she who should have
been the recipient.</p>

<p>The task I had entrusted to my solicitor was one of extreme difficulty, but
fortunately for me he was a man of inflexible resolution and perfect
self-possession, qualities which made him more than a match for Maxwell, who
undertook the management of Barbara&#39;s affairs. Every resistance was made to the
carrying out of my plans, and a solicitor of doubtful reputation was employed by
Maxwell to threaten and bluster. My own solicitor made light of this.</p>

<p>&quot;It will do them no good to go to law,&quot; he said to me. &quot;The only satisfaction
they would get would be the bringing up of your name before the public. The fact
of their employing a lawyer of such a character shows that they are aware of the
weakness of their case. In no event would they benefit to a greater extent than
you propose.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a wearisome and distressing business, and it is needless to say that I
took no pleasure in it. I was animated by no sense of triumph, and was only
upheld by my stern determination not to be turned from my purpose. Finally,
Maxwell adopted other tactics. &quot;The income you offer my poor sister,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;is utterly inadequate for her support. Through your misconduct she is now in
such a deplorable state of health that the utmost care is needed. Make it five
hundred pounds a year, and a public exposure of your brutality will be avoided.
Within a few days of your marriage Barbara discovered that you had a mistress,
and as a man of the world I know that there has been all through another woman
in the case. It will be worth your while to make it five hundred pounds. I am
not at the end of my resources, and if you refuse to act in a sensible way I
will make it warm for you. You shall not have a moment&#39;s peace.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, after the lapse of several weeks, the distressing affair was brought
to a conclusion. The house was sold, and Barbara removed from it, taking with
her the whole of the furniture, to which, for the sake of peace, I offered no
objection. The worry and anxiety had affected my health. Living alone, with no
friend to cheer me, I should have felt myself a complete outcast from the world
had in not been for the regular correspondence I kept up with Ellen. Her letters
were my only comfort, and I may truly say that they preserved the balance of my
mind. Confident as I was in the justice of my cause it may have been that, but
for the consolation I drew from them, I should have again given way to despair.
The natural reserve which distinguished her letters when she first began to
write to me had melted away, and she wrote now as to a friend of long standing.</p>

<p>It was at this period that I received a letter from her mother. She said that
her daughter did not know she was communicating with me, and that her letter was
posted by a servant in the farmhouse. There was something on her mind which she
wished to impart to me, and she had also an earnest desire to see the friend to
whom they were so deeply indebted. If my engagements in London would permit of
it she would esteem it an honor to shake hands with their dearest friend and
confide to him a secret which was oppressing her.</p>

<p>The request came opportunely. The good doctor had spoken of my changed
appearance, and had advised me to go into the country for a rest.</p>

<p>&quot;Would Swanage suit me?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I prescribe Swanage,&quot; he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>He knew me only as John Fletcher, and had no suspicion that I was a married
man.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession20" href="#ch20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">I now approach a period in my life which, in comparison with what
I have already related, shines like a garden in an arid desert—a fair garden
blooming with the flowers of peace and happiness. It is not easy to say when I
began to love Ellen, and she has confessed that she does not know when she began
to love me. Chance, or fate, led us to each other, and has led us to the end,
which is very near. Much of the past I would undo were it in my power, but,
although a miracle would be needed to free me from the peril in which I stand, I
would not undo that part of it which Ellen and I shared together despite the
fact that it may be said to have created the mystery in which I am entangled. I
have read somewhere how a withered rose may be restored to freshness and
sweetness. So was it with my life in the hour that Ellen and I first met.</p>

<p>I did not go down to Swanage immediately. With the knowledge that my enemies
were at work, I waited a few days alert and on the watch, and when I reached the
delightful spot it was by devious ways and cunning breaks in my journey which
would have puzzled the smartest human bloodhound that could have been set to
track me. Meanwhile I wrote both to Ellen and her mother, saying that I intended
to visit them shortly and that no further letters were to be sent to me in
London. That was all the notice I gave them, and when I presented myself it was
at an unexpected moment.</p>

<p>The day was bright and fine, the sea calm and benignant, the air already
fragrant with the promise of spring. I walked towards the farmhouse as a man
newly born to joy might have done. Friends true and sincere awaited my coming,
and those who have read these pages will understand what that meant to me.</p>

<p>Ellen sprang from the house at my approach. She had seen my form in the
distance, and, as I came nearer, recognized and flew to welcome me.</p>

<p>&quot;My friend!&quot; she murmured, holding out her two hands.</p>

<p>I dropped my bag and clasped them. &quot;Ellen—I beg your pardon, Miss Cameron!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Ellen, if you wish it.&quot;</p>

<p>We gazed at each other, she with a blush on her cheeks, but with no false
modesty or reserve, and I in a dream of happiness.</p>

<p>&quot;I have taken you by surprise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The pleasantest of surprises. Every day we have been hoping you would come;
every day we have been looking out for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your mother—how is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better, she says, and brighter—Oh, so much brighter! What do we not owe
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg you never to say that again. You owe me nothing. One day I may perhaps
tell you what I owe you. Your mother is better. That is good news. And you—but I
need scarcely ask.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never been so well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More good news. The day is propitious. You saw me coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother and I were sitting by the open window. We are not overrun by company;
that makes it all the more delightful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are fond of the country?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love it. We are closer to what is best in the world. There is my mother at
the window. She thinks it so strange that she has never seen you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she will see me now—and will be disappointed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. That is not possible. You are her hero.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that makes it all the more certain. We raise an ideal; best never to see
it in flesh and blood. Reality is a disenchanter. Far better to continue to
dream.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said this I gazed at Ellen, and there must have been a growing
earnestness in my gaze. I had raised an ideal of her—had it met with
disappointment? I was self-convicted.</p>

<p>&quot;I recant,&quot; I added in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad,&quot; she said, and my heart beat more quickly at the thought that she
understood me.</p>

<p>We were within a dozen yards of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>&quot;Does your mother recognize us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hardly. She is very short-sighted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us walk quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron rose, her hand at her heart, in a state of agitation. I observed
that she rose with difficulty; before we reached her she sank into her chair.</p>

<p>&quot;It is Mr. Fletcher, mother.&quot;</p>

<p>I prevented her from rising again, perceiving that she was not strong, and I
did not interrupt the little speech in which she gratefully welcomed me. There
was a strong likeness between her and Ellen; though worn with suffering, I
noticed the same delicately cut features, the same trustful eyes, in which the
spirit of goodness shone. Sitting there, talking to her, it seemed to me as if I
had rejoined a family knit to me by close ties of sympathy and kinship. Ellen
had taken up her work, and was busy with her needle.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it you are making?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;A dress for one of the landlady&#39;s children,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>On a chair by Mrs. Cameron&#39;s side was another dress of a similar character.</p>

<p>&quot;We are not good dressmakers,&quot; said Mrs. Cameron; &quot;but we manage these little
frocks very well. Our landlady has a large family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you working for money?&quot; I inquired, gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it is against the rules. You did not come here to work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot be idle,&quot; said Mrs. Cameron. &quot;It is not work; it is pleasure. When
night comes we lay the needle aside. It was not so in London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I have heard. Still, I repeat, you should not work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We should be unhappy without it. We do not tire ourselves. How long do you
intend to stay in Swanage, Mr. Fletcher?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Several weeks, I hope. I am here for a holiday, by the doctor&#39;s orders.&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen raised her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you are not well,&quot; said Mrs. Cameron, quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I have had a great deal of anxiety lately. Don&#39;t look troubled. It is over
now—happily over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I am glad. Ellen, we must take care of Mr. Fletcher.&quot; The young girl
nodded sympathetically. &quot;There is a vacant room in the farmhouse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I will find a bedroom elsewhere; but if you will allow me, I will take
my meals with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be a great pleasure to us. There is another farmhouse half a mile
away, where you can get a room. Ellen will show you the way. There is no hurry
for a few minutes. We must go into accounts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Accounts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Cameron, and at a sign from her, Ellen brought forward a
small account book. &quot;You have sent us more money than we need. We can&#39;t quite
keep ourselves, but we can do something towards it. You will find the figures
correct, I think, though we are not very clever at arithmetic.&quot;</p>

<p>It was useless for me to protest; they had their ideas of what was just, and
seeing that I was giving them pain by objecting, I waived further objection, and
looked through the book. Everything was neatly set down. I had sent them so much
money; they had earned so much; their weekly account for board and lodging came
to so much; and in the result there was a balance of four or five pounds, which
they insisted belonged to me, and which I was forced to accept. If any proof
were needed to convince me that I had been thrown into the society of ladies of
scrupulous integrity and uprightness, it lay before me in this little account
book; it increased my respect and esteem for them, and I thanked my good fortune
for the association, and inwardly vowed never to desert them. What the mother
had to impart to me was disclosed within twenty-four hours of my arrival. It was
sufficiently grave, and strengthened my resolve to remain with them.</p>

<p>&quot;My days are numbered, Mr. Fletcher,&quot; she said in a tone of much sweetness
and resignation. &quot;Ellen does not know the truth; I have kept it from her. Dear
child, she has had enough to bear. She has nursed me for years, and does not see
the signs which I feel are unmistakable and irrevocable. When the blow comes,
she will suffer terribly; it would be cruel to destroy the peace we are now
enjoying. It is peace, blessed, blessed peace—peace and rest; and I wait with
patience, and with infinite confidence in the will of the Supreme. I think it
will come soon, and as the dear friend whom God sent to us in our darkest hour,
I wished you to know. Do not think it is an old woman speaking to you out of her
fears. I do not fear death. There is a hereafter, and I shall see my dear child
again when her time comes. I should welcome the hour when I am summoned were it
not for my darling and for the grief in store for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not old,&quot; I said in a low tone, &quot;and there is still hope. Ellen
tells me you are only forty-five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, I know, but my sands are run, and there is no appeal.&quot;</p>

<p>And, indeed, as I looked at her I felt there was none; death was in her face,
which, in her daughter&#39;s presence, ordinarily wore a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;There is no hope, Mr. Fletcher; the most skillful medical advice would not
avail me now. What mortal could do for me you have done; you have prolonged my
life, and I am inexpressibly grateful to you. Has Ellen told you we have no
relatives?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have none. Ellen will be left alone, to battle with the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not while I have life, Mrs. Cameron.&quot; She stretched forth her trembling
hand, and the expression on her face was that of an angel in the act of
blessing.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear friend, dear friend!&quot; she murmured, and the tears ran down her
cheeks. &quot;God sent you to us—truly, truly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was for this assurance you sent for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hoped for it—prayed for it—and my prayers are answered. Sorrow is our
heritage, but the world is full of goodness. God never sleeps; His watchful eye
is eternally over us. You are young; never lose sight of this, never forget it,
never lose your faith in Him. Ellen is brave; she knows no fear, and is prepared
to fight the battle; faith and prayer are her support. There is something I
ought to tell you about her, but I should like you not to mention it to her.
Since we have been here she has had an offer of marriage. A gentleman—no, not
exactly a gentleman in the ordinary sense—a man working for his living, came to
this place in the performance of a duty. He was unknown to us, but, his duty
performed, he came again—twice. He had seen Ellen, and confessed his love for
her. I need not mention his name, for the affair is over, so far as we are
concerned. She refused him, and he appealed to me, and frankly explained his
position to me. His calling is not a high one, but he satisfied me that he could
keep a wife in fair comfort. Anxious for Ellen&#39;s future, I spoke to her, and she
listened patiently; she is never violent or unreasonable. Her answer to me was
the same she had given to him. She would never marry a man she did not love. For
one she loved she would make any sacrifice, endure any hardship, but where her
heart was not engaged she could entertain no feeling but friendship—and that was
not enough. I did not argue with her; I made no attempt to persuade her. The
sentiments she uttered were my own, the lot she chose was the same I had chosen
for myself. I married a poor man, and though he died early and my life has been
a life of struggle, I never repented, never thought I had acted unwisely. So
Ellen&#39;s suitor went away, but I doubt whether he will ever forget her. There was
much that was good in him. Before he left he said that if it was ever in his
power to serve her she had only to come to him and he would do his best for her.
I am sure he loved her, and I am sure that Ellen, not loving him, did what was
right. This is Ellen&#39;s secret, Mr. Fletcher.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will respect it,&quot; I said. &quot;Unless she mentions it to me herself she will
never know that I am in possession of it.&quot;</p>

<p>There was much more than this said during our interview, but I have given the
gist of our conversation, and I left Mrs. Cameron with a sad feeling that her
forebodings would be realized.</p>

<p>As, indeed, they were before the end of the month. She suffered no pain, but
became so feeble that she could not take a step without support. She did not
keep her bed; by the doctor&#39;s permission, and at her own wish, she sat at the
window during the day in an easy chair which I obtained for her. There she could
watch the advance of spring and breathe the balmy air; there she could see Ellen
and me, whom she sent frequently into the open, saying it would do us harm to
keep constantly in doors in such lovely weather. We never went far from her; the
slightest motion of her hand, or her gentle voice calling &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Ellen,&quot;
brought us to her side, eager to do what she required. There was always a smile
upon her face, a smile of peace, and content, and love, and I think her last
days on earth were the happiest she had ever spent. She said as much: &quot;I am
quite, quite happy, dear children; do not grieve for me. In everything before me
I see the goodness of God; I seem to see His face.&quot; When she raised her eyes to
the bright clouds it was my firm belief that she beheld a spiritual vision of
His glory, and when she lowered them to earth she saw a deeper meaning than we
in the evidences of His wondrous power. She drew keen delight from the flowers
and birds, from the air which floated from the sea, from the early budding of
the trees. Not a murmur passed her lips, not a word of complaining. &quot;I shall see
all these things with a clearer eye presently,&quot; she said, &quot;and bye and bye you
will see them with me. Bear your trials patiently; do your work in the world,
and let your mind dwell upon His love and goodness.&quot; She relied greatly upon me.
It was I who carried her from room to room—Ellen not being strong enough for the
task; it was I who sat by her side when she insisted upon Ellen taking a little
rest during the day. Ellen needed this, for I knew, without being told, that she
watched by her mother&#39;s bedside night after night without closing her eyes.
Every evening I read aloud a chapter from the Bible; not in the stateliest
church was truer devotion felt than in the room in which she lay dying. Once
when we were alone, she said:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you love Ellen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With more than my heart, mother; with my soul.&quot;</p>

<p>It was her wish that I should call her &quot;mother.&quot; On one occasion it escaped
me inadvertently, and she asked me always to address her so.</p>

<p>&quot;Ellen loves you,&quot; she said. &quot;You are a good man. I leave her in your care.&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke constantly of Ellen, and related stories of her childhood, drawing
from love&#39;s memory instances of Ellen&#39;s sweetness and unselfish affection.</p>

<p>&quot;We have been very poor,&quot; she said, &quot;but we had always one priceless
blessing—love.&quot;</p>

<p>As with her towards Ellen, so was it with Ellen towards her mother. With
tears in her eyes, the woman I loved related stories of the mother&#39;s continual
sacrifices for her child; how she had nursed her through sickness, denied
herself food for her, even begged for her. There was no shame in these
privations; the recalling of them brought into play the tenderest feelings; all
through, from mother to daughter, from daughter to mother, it was a song of
love, which it did me good to hear. Unselfishness and self-sacrifice on either
side, each striving to give the other the merit; poverty patiently borne, work
which resembled slavery cheerfully undertaken, the hardest trials encountered
with a brave heart; heroic qualities not properly recognized by mankind. Search
behind the veil—there you will see the human pulse throbbing to the touch of
attributes which it is not sacrilege to call divine.</p>

<p>I was lifted higher by this intercourse; the dust of self-complaining fell
from me; I felt myself purified. New views of life opened themselves to me; I
saw the poor in a different aspect. If saints are necessary, seek for them in
courts and alleys; you will find the true ones clothed in rags.</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts then; such are my thoughts to-day.</p>

<p>I turn to the first pages of this Confession, and I recognize the littleness
of spirit in which I wrote. I was forgetful of the lessons I learned from the
lips of pure souls. I am reminded of them, and I will meet my fate bravely,
without repining. The last day arrived. There was apparently no change in Mrs.
Cameron. She sat at the window, smiling towards us. The birds were singing; the
fragrance of flowers was in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother has fallen asleep,&quot; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Presently we want softly into the room, and stood by her side. We had
gathered flowers which Ellen placed in a vase, within reach of the mother&#39;s
hand. She liked simple flowers the best, modest stars, with tender color, which
grow by the wayside. I held my breath; the light of love and pity shone in
Ellen&#39;s eyes. Gazing intently at the white, still face, a sudden fear shot
through me. I stooped, and placed my mouth close to hers.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother!&quot; cried Ellen, as I raised my head.</p>

<p>Never again on earth was that sacred word to receive an answer. Ellen and I
were alone.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession21" href="#ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Twelve happy months passed by. We were still in Swanage, but had
removed farther inland. It was by Ellen&#39;s desire that we remained; she wished to
be near her mother&#39;s grave.</p>

<p>We lived in a small cottage, the walls of which were covered with roses and
flowering vines. The few acres of land which belonged to us were rich in
fruit-trees and bushes, which, with our flower and kitchen gardens, kept us busy
pretty well all the day. What acquaintances we had—they were not many—were drawn
from the ranks of the poor, by whom Ellen was loved as few women are. A quiet,
happy life—if but the past could have been blotted out! I had not concealed my
story from Ellen&#39;s knowledge, but before it was told I knew that I had won her
love, and she knew that to live without her would be worse than death to me. For
me she sacrificed herself, and I, in the selfishness of my heart, accepted the
sacrifice only too gladly and willingly. Questioning my conscience I did not
reproach myself, though sometimes I trembled for Ellen; and she, I am sure,
never for one moment reproached me, and did not tremble for herself. If a cloud
was on my brow she chased it away with tender words. Man&#39;s law prevented me from
giving her my name; God&#39;s law joined us and made us one. The beauty of her
character awoke all that was good within me; she was to me like the sun and dew
to the opening flower.</p>

<p>I was guilty of one act of duplicity, and I bitterly repented it. I did not
disclose to her my true name, but retained that by which I had introduced myself
to her. She knew me only as John Fletcher.</p>

<p>Twelve happy months, and I had almost taught myself to forget. One morning
Ellen whispered to me a secret which filled me with joy and fear. Into her heart
fear did not enter; it was pulsing with the joy of motherhood; in a few months
we should have a child.</p>

<p>I walked alone to the seashore deep in thought.</p>

<p>My sense of security was disturbed; I had now again to reckon with the world.
A father owes a duty to his child which the world will not allow him to forget.
And the mother!—yes, it was of Ellen I chiefly thought, and it was to her,
presently, that my thoughts were chiefly directed. For, looking up, I saw within
a dozen yards of me a man whose mocking eyes were following my movements. Though
there was a change in his appearance I knew him immediately, and I caught my
breath in sudden alarm. The man was Maxwell.</p>

<p>The change I had observed was in his circumstances. His shabby clothes and
hat, his boots down at heel, his unshaven face, denoted that he had not
prospered lately. But there was a light in his face as our eyes met resembling
that of one upon whom had unexpectedly fallen a stroke of good fortune.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you, John?&quot; he said, advancing with outstretched hand. &quot;But why ask?
You look like a cherub—rosy, fat and sleek. I rejoice—and you, too, eh? What is
there so delightful as the renewal of old affectionate ties, broken through a
misconception? Do you see my hand held out in friendship? Better take it, John.
No? You are wrong, brother-in-law, very wrong. You were always rash, always
acting upon impulse, always fond of romance, always being led away by false
notions of right and wrong. I frequently offered you advice which you would not
take. In effect I was constantly saying to you, &#39;Be worldly, my boy; take the
world as you find it, and make the best of it, not the worst.&#39; That is my way,
though it has treated me scurvily since we met. What do I do? Repine? Not a bit
of it. &#39;Luck will turn,&#39; said I to myself, and here&#39;s the proof. Luck has
turned.&quot;</p>

<p>During this speech, which was very heartily spoken, he walked close to my
side with a hateful affectation of cordiality. As I did not answer him, he
continued:</p>

<p>&quot;Why so silent, my dear John? Are you overcome by your feelings? Ah, yes,
that must be it. Sudden joy confounds a man—makes it difficult for him to
express himself. Now, I am never at a loss for words, but then I am older than
you, more accustomed to ups and downs. I don&#39;t mind confessing to you—with a
proper knowledge of your sympathetic nature—that I have had during the last
twelve months any number of &#39;downs&#39; and no &#39;ups&#39; worth mentioning. All my little
ventures and speculations have come to grief. Half-a-dozen times I have been on
the point of making my fortune and have been baulked by want of cash. You don&#39;t
play cards, I believe. I do. You don&#39;t care for racing. I do. You don&#39;t tempt
fortune by crying double or quits. I do. It&#39;s in my blood. I give you my word I
should have been as right as a trivet if it hadn&#39;t been that just at the
critical moment I found myself cursed with an empty purse. Devilish hard, wasn&#39;t
it, when a fellow has a rich brother-in-law who would have said, &#39;Here&#39;s my
purse, old boy; go in and win.&#39; The mischief of it was that this dear friend had
run off to lotus-land, to revel in the lap of beauty and virtue, the world
forgetting, but not by the world forgot. No, John, not by the world forgot. We
bore the absent one in mind; we talked of his excellencies; we deplored his
absence; we longed for his return to the fold.&quot;</p>

<p>He now went to the length of linking his arm with mine; I wrenched myself
free.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it you want of me?&quot; I demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;The oracle speaks,&quot; he cried, gaily. &quot;What do I want? What does every one
want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Money?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Intelligence returns,&quot; he answered, &quot;and we are getting into smooth water.
Yes, John; money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you track me here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;John, John,&quot; he said, reproachfully. &quot;Do I look like a spy? Did you ever
know me to be guilty of a mean action?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Answer my question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Being in the witness box I use the customary formula. From information
received I was led to suppose that the lost one would be found on this beautiful
shore. I flew hither on the wings of love, anxious to serve him, to show my
interest in his welfare, to promote his happiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I refuse to give you money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be unwise, John, distinctly unwise, and will carry with it certain
consequences exceedingly disagreeable to—let us say to a lady of spotless
reputation. How pained I should be to set these consequences in motion! Is it
not man&#39;s privilege to protect the weak? But, alas, John! alas! alas! necessity
is a slave-driver, and compels tender hearts to lay on the lash!&quot;</p>

<p>With his old mocking smile upon his face, he went through the pretense of
drying his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Speak plainly,&quot; I said. &quot;If I disappoint your expectations, what will you
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will deal honestly by you, brother-in-law, and speak, as you desire, quite
plainly. What will I do? Let me see. There is no place on earth, be it ever so
remote and secluded, in which character is not at a premium. There are husbands
who have wives, parents who have daughters. A woman comes to live among them who
poses as Madame Virtue. She is good to the poor—it costs so little, John, to be
good to the poor; the clergyman&#39;s wife visits her; she goes to church; she gives
a basin of soup to an old woman. Cheap tricks, brother-in-law. Madame Virtue
leads a happy life; she is respected; people greet her smilingly and
affectionately, and say, &#39;There&#39;s an example for you!&#39; Suddenly a rumor is set
afloat that Madame Virtue is no better than she should be. Sad, very sad. The
rumor is authenticated. A gentleman comes from the city and verifies the rumor.
Madame Virtue has, of course, a reputed husband, who shares her popularity. The
gentleman says he knows the saintly couple very well indeed, and that they are
simply a pair of impostors. He offers to supply proof, and he does so upon the
invitation of the clergyman and the local gentry. He regrets the necessity, but
what can he do? He owes a duty to society. If there is one thing, John, I pride
myself upon more than another, it is that I never shrink from the performance of
a duty. What is the result in this instance? The clergyman&#39;s wife turns her back
upon Madame Virtue, the local gentry likewise; the poor lose their respect for
her, and talk of her behind her back. In a word, the saint is turned into a
sinner. Judge the effect upon Madame Virtue, you, dear brother-in-law, who know
her so much better than I. Have I put the matter plainly? There is even more to
say which it might not be agreeable to you to hear. Take a turn or two on these
beautiful sands, and think it over. I can wait.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not disguise from myself that for a time at least, I was in this man&#39;s
power, and that his malice would carry him even farther than he had threatened.
The effect upon Ellen would be serious. She valued the respect in which she was
held, and drew happiness from the affection by which she was surrounded.
Moreover, she was in a delicate state of health, and I dreaded the consequences
which would follow Maxwell&#39;s malignity. At all risks, at all hazards, I must
purchase his silence.</p>

<p>&quot;You are in want of money,&quot; I said, &quot;and you come to extort it from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in want of everything,&quot; he retorted, &quot;but I am still a gentleman. If
you are not more particular in your language, I will set my heel upon you and
Madame Virtue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Name your price,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, now we are getting sensible. My price? I must consider. For to-day,
fifty pounds—as an installment, John. This day week we will have another chat,
and come to terms.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew it was useless to argue or protest; he held me bound and would show no
mercy. I had not so much money about me, and I proposed to bring it in a couple
of days to any address he named.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said. &quot;You can come with me to the private boarding-house where
I have engaged a bed, and can write me a cheque there. A man of means always
carries his cheque-book with him. Unless you prefer to invite me to dinner at
your lovers&#39; nest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will come with you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>On our way he reproached me for not asking after Barbara, and I replied that
I received all the news I wished to hear through my solicitor. He entertained
me, however, with a long account of her, which I knew to be false, and to which
I listened in silence. She was much better, he said, and was looking forward to
the end of our differences. She had become a convert to the Catholic Church, and
was held in the highest esteem by the priests and nuns; the children in the
schools doated on her; she deprived herself to provide them with clothes and
food; she prayed for me day and night, etcetera, etcetera. And all the time he
regaled me with this tissue of falsehoods he was laughing at me in his sleeve.
The truth about her was that her excesses had become even more frightful than in
my experiences of her; she had not a sober hour, and was continually turned out
of her lodgings. Maxwell was curious to ascertain how much of the truth I knew,
but I did not satisfy him. At the boarding-house I wrote a cheque for fifty
pounds, and made an appointment to meet him that day week, when we were to &quot;come
to terms.&quot;</p>

<p>I said nothing to Ellen of this meeting or of the misery into which I was
plunged. To have made her a sharer in my unhappiness would serve me no good
purpose. On the appointed day Maxwell and I met again, and then he named a sum
so large that I hesitated. It amounted, indeed, to a third of what remained of
my fortune.</p>

<p>&quot;You refuse?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I must,&quot; I replied. &quot;I will not submit to be beggared by you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sheer nonsense, John. I have made a calculation, and I know, within a
hundred or two, how much you are worth. Cast your eyes over these figures.&quot;</p>

<p>To my surprise I discovered that his calculation was as nearly as possible
correct, and that by some means he was fairly well acquainted with my pecuniary
position.</p>

<p>&quot;It is for you to decide,&quot; he said. &quot;I have something to sell which you are
anxious to purchase. You can make either a friend or an enemy of me, and you
know whether it will be worth your while to buy. I don&#39;t deny that I am hard up,
and that in a certain sense you represent my last chance. I am not fool enough
to throw it away. Understand clearly—I intend to make the best of it. You see,
John, I hold the reins, and I can tool you comfortably down a safe and pleasant
road, or I can send you headlong to the devil—and in your company Madame Virtue.
I have learned something since last week. You are living here under an assumed
name, and I have a suspicion that Madame Virtue is not aware of it. Another
trump card in my hand. It rests with me whether I bring about an introduction
between Barbara and Madame Virtue, and whether I bring your excellent stepmother
and Louis down upon you. There&#39;s no escape for you, brother-in-law. Best make a
friend of me, my boy, and keep the game to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end I consented, with some modification, to his terms, upon his
promise that he would never molest me again; and so we parted.</p>

<p>Months passed and I heard nothing more of him. Gradually I recovered my peace
of mind. We were living modestly within our means; peace had been cheaply
purchased.</p>

<p>Our child was born, a boy. The delight he brought in our home cannot be
described. He was a heavenly link in our love, and bound Ellen and me closely
together. I will not dwell upon that joyful time. This confession is longer than
I conceived it would be, and events of a more exciting nature claim attention.</p>

<p>One evening upon my return home, after transacting some business in
Bournemouth in connection with my affairs, Ellen, speaking of what had occurred
during my absence, mentioned a gentlemanly beggar who had solicited alms from
her. He had told her a plausible tale of unmerited misfortune, and of having
been brought down in the world by trusting a friend who had deceived and robbed
him. She described the man, and my heart was like lead; I recognized the
villain.</p>

<p>&quot;He was so nice to baby,&quot; said Ellen, &quot;and spoke so beautifully of our home.
Poverty is much harder to gentlefolk who have been used to comfort than it is to
poor people. I pitied him from my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beggars do not always say what is true,&quot; I observed.</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise. &quot;He could hardly be called a beggar, John. Did
I not do right in relieving him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite right, dear,&quot; I said, with an inward prayer that I was mistaken in the
man.</p>

<p>&quot;I am quite sure he spoke the truth,&quot; she said, and there, as between us, the
matter ended.</p>

<p>Before many hours had passed my fears were confirmed. I kept watch from the
cottage, and saw Maxwell in the distance, coming in our direction. I went to
meet him.</p>

<p>&quot;This is friendly of you, John,&quot; he said. &quot;Where shall we talk? In the
society of the charming Madame Virtue and her sweet babe, or alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alone,&quot; I replied. &quot;I forbid you to present yourself in my house again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A tall word, John, forbid. It depends, my boy, upon you. Keep a civil tongue
in your head, and be amenable to reason, and you shall continue to tread the
path of righteousness and peace. Defy me, and up the three of you go. A pretty
piece of goods, Madame Virtue, mild-tempered and long suffering, a different
kind of character from my adorable sister. I can imagine a scene between
them—Madame Virtue soft, pleading, reproachful; Barbara hot, flaming,
revengeful. But perhaps I mistake. When a woman discovers that she has been
betrayed and deceived she occasionally turns into a fury. I know something of
the sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You promised not to molest me again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I molesting you? I come in brotherly love to lay my sorrows at your feet.
John, I am broke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not my business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, it is. We are partners in goodness, mutually bound to spare a
charming lady and her sweet babe from a sorrow worse than death. It is a mission
I love; it appeals to my tenderest feelings. I feel good all over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a devil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In humility I bow my head. Revile me, John, pour burning coals upon me; I
shall enjoy it all the more. Here I stand prepared for the martyr&#39;s stake.&quot;</p>

<p>My blood boiled; I gave him a dangerous look. &quot;You are trying my patience too
far. Drive me to desperation, and I will not answer for the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drive me to desperation,&quot; he said, pausing to light a cigarette, &quot;and I will
hunt her into the gutter. I will make her life a living misery, and when the end
comes she shall curse you with her dying breath. Nothing like frankness, dear
John. Behold me, an epitome of it.&quot;</p>

<p>If I had not turned from him I should have committed some act of violence. It
was thought of Ellen alone that restrained me, that enabled me to regain my
self-command. He struck at her, not at me, and well did he know his power. When
I was living with Barbara, I believed that suffering had reached its limit; I
was to learn that I was mistaken. Hitherto I had suffered for myself, a selfish
feeling affecting only my life and future, but now that another being had wound
herself into my heart, a sweet and loving woman whose happiness was in my hands,
my former misery seemed light indeed. And her babe—my own dear child! To allow
passion to master me would have been unpardonable.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you cooler, John?&quot; asked Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;In God&#39;s name,&quot; I cried, &quot;tell me why you continue to persecute me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In God&#39;s name, I will. I regret to say, I am suffering from the old
complaint, John. Misfortune pursues me, and if I don&#39;t have a couple of hundred
pounds——&quot;</p>

<p>I would hear no more. I went with him to a public-house, and wrote a cheque
for the amount.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a trump,&quot; he said, pocketing the cheque. &quot;Upon my soul, if you had a
better knowledge of me you would find I am not such a bad fellow, after all; but
when needs must, John, the devil drives.&quot;</p>

<p>That night I told Ellen that we must remove from Swanage.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be very sorry, John, dear,&quot; she said. &quot;Is it really necessary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is imperative, Ellen.&quot;</p>

<p>She sighed. &quot;We have been so happy here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can be happy elsewhere, dearest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, truly,&quot; she said, brightening up, &quot;so long as we are together what does
it matter where we live?&quot;</p>

<p>My idea was to escape from my enemy; to hide ourselves in some corner in
England, where we should be safe from his cruel persecution. After much study
and cogitation I fixed upon Cornwall, and thither we went, and established
ourselves in a cottage on the outskirts of Penzance. I was in a fever of alarm
during the removal, and kept unceasingly on the watch, but observed nothing to
cause me apprehension. When we were settled I breathed more freely; here,
surely, in this remote place, we should be secure. Ellen was cheerful and
bright, and she made me so. Her time was fully occupied; she had not an idle
moment; she did not allow herself one. Our child, the garden, the home, kept her
busy. Her consideration for me, the loving attention she paid to my slightest
wish, even anticipated it, touched me deeply. Tenderness was expressed in every
word she spoke, in every movement she made. It would be impossible for me to
describe how dear she was to me. It is such as she who have raised woman to the
position she holds in the scale of humanity.</p>

<p>What troubled me greatly was the state of my finances. The inroads made upon
my purse by Maxwell&#39;s exactions were so serious that I foresaw the time when, if
my wife&#39;s allowance was to be continued, I should find myself penniless. We were
living at a moderate rate, our expenses being under three pounds a week. The
money I had left, apart from the allowance to Barbara, capitalized, would bring
in a little over fifty pounds a year, and I felt that I was daily jeopardizing
Ellen&#39;s future and the future of our child, as well as my own. I was not a
business man, and had no trade to which I could turn my hand; in England my only
weapon was my pen—a poor weapon to most who have to live by it. The difficulty
was solved presently by events of which I was not the originator. Meanwhile I
wrote a short story which I read to Ellen, and was pleased with myself. Needless
to say, she was delighted with it, and elevated me immediately upon the pinnacle
of fame. Under a nom de plume, I sent it to a magazine; it was declined. I sent
it to another magazine, with the same result. This second refusal came when we
had been four weeks in Cornwall, and I went from my house to post it to a third
editor when, almost at the door, I saw Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, John,&quot; he cried with brazen effrontery, &quot;like a bad penny returned. I
can&#39;t afford to lose sight of you. What a sly dog you are! but I am a slyer. It
is an amusing game. Set a thief to catch a thief, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is you who are the thief,&quot; I said, all my fears returning, &quot;but you have
had your journey for nothing this time. You can get nothing more out of me for
the best of reasons; you have robbed me of almost my last penny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall see. So you thought to give me the slip. You may thank your stars
you did not succeed. I have come to see you not on my account, but on
Barbara&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might have spared yourself the trouble,&quot; I said, coldly. &quot;I have nothing
to say to her; she can have nothing to say to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is where you are mistaken. Passion blinds you, John. Mind, I don&#39;t mean
to say you have nothing to complain of. I see now that you were not suited to
one another, and I dare say I was to blame in not opening your eyes before you
married her. There were reasons. In the first place—I admit it frankly—I wanted
to get rid of her. I am no saint, but she tired me out; honestly, I was sick of
her. In the second place, she bound me down. &#39;It is my last chance,&#39; she said.
Why, she was engaged three times before you met her, and was found out in time
by her lovers, who were not slow in beating a retreat. You were the unlucky one
to fall into the trap, and though I&#39;ve been hard on you I am sorry for you. In
running away from her and taking up with another woman you did what I should
have done if I had been in your place. However, it is all at an end now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At an end!&quot; I echoed, regarding him with amazement</p>

<p>&quot;At an end,&quot; he repeated, gravely. &quot;You will soon be free, and then I suppose
you will wash your hands of me. Well! Perhaps I shall have a bit of luck in
another quarter. I don&#39;t mind telling you that I had a man watching you all the
time you were in Swanage. I knew when you left and where you ran to. I could
have been here three weeks ago if I wished, and I have only come to bring you
the news. Barbara is dying.&quot;</p>

<p>God forgive me, the exclamation that escaped me was not one of horror, but of
relief; and the next moment I was shocked at myself.</p>

<p>&quot;She has behaved abominably,&quot; he continued, &quot;but after all, she is your wife,
and you can hardly refuse to see her, and whisper a word of
forgiveness—supposing we are in time. I left her this morning; the doctor was
with her, and said he doubted whether she would live over to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is so sudden,&quot; I said, and still my thoughts continued to dwell upon
Ellen and our child. &quot;Has she been long ill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She has not been ill at all in that sense,&quot; he replied. &quot;It was an accident.
Yesterday morning, when she was in her usual state—you understand, John—she
slipped from the top of the stairs to the bottom, and broke her spine. The
moment the doctor saw her he said there was no hope. Will you come?&quot;</p>

<p>It was my duty; I should have been less than man had I hesitated. &quot;Yes,&quot; I
said, &quot;I will come. When is the train?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It starts in an hour if you can get ready by that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will meet you at the station,&quot; I said, and went at once to Ellen to inform
her of what had occurred. She approved of my going, and hastened my departure.
For Barbara she had only words of pity, and her eyes overflowed in commiseration
for the wasted life so near its end. In this crisis it would have been contrary
to nature had we not thought of ourselves, and of what Barbara&#39;s death meant to
us, but it was a subject we avoided. I breathed a blessing over our sleeping
child, and promising to write to Ellen directly I got to London, I bade her
good-bye.</p>

<p>Maxwell was at the station.</p>

<p>&quot;Plenty of time, John,&quot; he said, &quot;the train doesn&#39;t start for half an hour.
You&#39;ll stand me a brandy and soda and a sandwich, I suppose. I haven&#39;t had a
bite or a drink since the morning. I&#39;m shipwrecked again. Serve me right, you&#39;ll
say. So say I. I shall have to turn over a new leaf. Would you believe I had to
travel third-class, and didn&#39;t have money enough to pay for a return ticket?
Hard lines for a gentleman; but such is life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;ll have to travel back third-class,&quot; I said. &quot;I have no money to waste.&quot;</p>

<p>He grumbled at this, but I paid no heed to him. After disposing of his brandy
and soda he asked for another, which I refused. He laughed, and complimented me
upon displaying a strength of character which he had not given me credit for. If
I had not hurried him we would have missed the train.</p>

<p>Few people were traveling by it, and we had a compartment to ourselves. Such
conversation as we had on the journey was of his seeking; meeting with no
encouragement from me he leant back moodily and closed his eyes. Quite two hours
passed without a word being exchanged, when suddenly he said:</p>

<p>&quot;John, after Barbara&#39;s death you will marry Madame Virtue, of course. How
soon after? I shall expect an invitation, old fellow.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not answer him, and he made no further attempts at conversation. At the
end of our journey I asked him where Barbara lived.</p>

<p>&quot;Islington way,&quot; he said, sulkily, and calling a cab, gave the driver the
address.</p>

<p>The cab pulled up at the door of a wretched house in a narrow street between
&quot;The Angel&quot; and the Agricultural Hall. I paid the man and followed Maxwell to
the second floor, where, opening a door, he fell back, motioning me to enter
first.</p>

<p>The room was in semi-darkness, the window-curtains being drawn down.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that you, John?&quot; a voice asked, and at the same moment the curtains were
drawn aside.</p>

<p>It was the voice of my stepmother. From an inner room came the sound of
driveling laughter.</p>

<p>As I turned and saw Maxwell standing with his back against the door, and an
insolent smile on his face, suspicion entered my mind. It was to some extent
confirmed when I observed the insolent smile reflected on the face of my
stepmother.</p>

<p>&quot;Barbara is still alive, dear brother-in-law,&quot; said Maxwell, laughing quietly
to himself. &quot;You are in time, you see. Oh, yes, you are in time.&quot;</p>

<p>I threw open the door of the adjoining room. A strange woman was there,
standing by a chair in which Barbara was lolling. Except that she had grown more
unwieldy, that her eyes were bleared and dim, and that her driveling mouth and
hanging jaws gave her the appearance of a besotted hag, she bore no traces of a
mortal illness such as Maxwell had described. The truth rushed upon me with
convincing force. I had been tricked.</p>

<p>&quot;Neat, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; exclaimed Maxwell, as I closed the door upon the
disgusting sight. &quot;Would you believe,&quot; addressing my stepmother, &quot;that our dear
John was actually calculating the time when he would be free to marry the low
woman for whom he deserted his lawful wife?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would believe anything of him,&quot; said my stepmother.</p>

<p>&quot;I warn you,&quot; I said. &quot;Another such allusion, and I will thrash you within an
inch of your life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I&#39;m not to be frightened by threats,&quot; he blustered, &quot;and I&#39;m not going
to quarrel with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will gain nothing by the trick you have played me,&quot; I said. &quot;I am
already making your sister an allowance which my means do not warrant, and which
no court of law would compel me to pay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A pretense of poverty for which we are prepared. And we are prepared also to
make your affairs public property unless you listen to reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are in the plot against me,&quot; I said to my stepmother.</p>

<p>&quot;That is a lie,&quot; she replied, composedly. &quot;I am not in any plot against you,
but I am ready to give evidence when called upon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are here, John, in the presence of a witness,&quot; said Maxwell, &quot;for the
purpose of coming to an understanding. You have had sufficient experience of me
to be aware by this time that you are no match for me. If you wish to be left in
peace, to lead any life you choose, you will have to pay for it. Shall I name
the price?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be quite useless. You will never obtain another shilling from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have the opportunity to consider it, John. For one thousand
pounds—a sum you can well afford to pay—you shall be left forever at peace, to
go your own way to the devil. I will bind myself never to molest you again by
any legal document you may lay before me. Consider it well, brother-in-law. What
I offer is worth the price.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It needs no consideration. You have my answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I give you a week to think it over,&quot; he continued. &quot;If then you persist in
your refusal, I will dog you like your shadow—and not only you but the lady;
observe how polite I am—in whom you take an interest. I will hunt you down and
make your life and hers a daily misery. You may be able to stand it for a time.
If I am any judge of appearances she will not. You have a gift of imagination.
Imagine the worst I can do, and you will fall short of the reality. If not for
your own sake, John, for hers, think it over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have my answer,&quot; I repeated; and brushing him aside, I left the house.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession22" href="#ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Before the expiring of the month from the date of the deception
practiced upon me I had put into execution a plan I formed while Maxwell was
threatening me. To continue to live in England persecuted by his malignant
ingenuity would have been an act of folly; to purchase intervals of peace at the
cost of being reduced to beggary in a year or two would have been no less. At
all hazards I was determined that some small sum should be secured to Ellen, to
shield her and our child from penury, and to this end I made over to her the
balance of my fortune, securely invested in Consols, the interest on which she
would receive monthly from my solicitor, the principal reverting to her at my
death. I take this opportunity of expressing my heartfelt thanks to this
gentleman for the faithful manner in which he has carried out my instructions
and executed the delicate business I entrusted to him. For my own immediate
necessities I took one hundred pounds, which indeed was all that remained after
the investment which secured to Ellen one pound a week during my lifetime. It
was my desire at first, that she should accompany me to Australia, but my
solicitor argued against it; and his arguments were strengthened by a medical
opinion that neither the voyage nor the Australian climate would be good for my
dear Ellen&#39;s health.</p>

<p>In the winding up of this business and the preparations for my departure, I
exercised the greatest caution and secrecy, in order that my enemies should have
no suspicion of the locality in which it was determined that Ellen should
reside. We chose London as offering the greatest security for her, and because
she would be within hail of my solicitor, to whom she was to apply for
protection in the event of molestation. The knowledge that I had baffled my
pursuers was a satisfaction to me, and more than once I put successfully into
practice the tactics I adopted when I first discovered I was being watched and
followed. With respect to our correspondence I arranged that my letters to
Ellen, and Ellen&#39;s to me, should be sent under cover to my solicitor, who would
forward them to their correct address. It was probable that I should be shifting
from place to place in Australia, and Ellen might have occasion to remove.
During the month a number of communications from Maxwell reached me through my
solicitor. Some contained threats, some invited me to a meeting in which a
modification of his terms could be discussed. I did not acknowledge one of these
letters, and in the last I received Maxwell wrote: &quot;I have discovered that it is
your intention to leave England with Madame Virtue and your precious infant. If
you think you will escape me you are mistaken. Go where you will you will be
shadowed and not allowed to rest until you come to terms. Be wise in time, dear
John.&quot; This threat did not alarm me; the discovery he announced was probably
mere guesswork; even if it were not, my departure would strengthen the chances
of Ellen&#39;s safety. Before I left there was still a neglected duty to perform—to
inform Ellen that I had deceived her as to my real name. She evinced no
surprise, and did not reproach me, nor did it shake her faith in me. From the
hour we met my dear Ellen has never uttered a word to cause me pain. Humbly do I
ask forgiveness for the sorrows I have brought upon her.</p>

<p>At length the day of our separation arrived. I had put off my departure to
the latest moment, and was to travel by the night train to meet my ship.</p>

<p>We sat together in Ellen&#39;s humble room, her head on my shoulder, our child in
my arms. Though he could not yet speak an intelligible word he had, thank God,
learned to love me. What Ellen and I had to say was but a repetition of the fond
assurances we had exchanged that we would be true to each other to the last hour
of our lives. She was outwardly more cheerful than I; such women as she have a
strength of endurance denied to man, whose courage often deserts him at the
supreme moment of a moral crisis.</p>

<p>Ellen rose to spread the cloth for our last meal together, and it touched me
to observe how she had consulted my tastes in what she had placed upon the
table. To please her I forced myself to eat, and supper ended, she gave her babe
the breast, her eyes shining with tenderness and love.</p>

<p>&quot;You must be brave, dear,&quot; she said. &quot;You must never lose heart—never for one
single moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you, Ellen, you must also be brave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am—I shall be; and cheerful, too. If I were to mope, dear, baby would
suffer—and that would never do, would it, darling?&quot;</p>

<p>I see her now a picture of sweetest motherhood, as she sat crooning to the
little fellow, who was drawing life and goodness from nature&#39;s fount. In the
dark watches of my lonely life the picture rose before me, and I saw the dear
woman with her baby at her breast, her tender eyes shining upon me. It taught me
patience, and never failed to comfort me. Across the seas a heart was throbbing
with love for the wanderer, a mother was whispering to her babe of the absent
father; an invisible link stretched from the quiet bush to the fevered city,
along which, in hours of unrest, sped the spiritual message: &quot;I am thinking of
you. Dear love, dear love, do not lose heart; I am thinking of you.&quot;</p>

<p>And so we parted. The last words were spoken, the last kiss given. I turned
and saw, through tears, Ellen standing at the door, a blessing on her lips, her
soul in her eyes. &quot;Farewell, dear heart, farewell!&quot;</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession23" href="#ch23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">It is not pertinent to my story to dwell at any length upon my
Australian experiences. As I am not writing for literary purposes, brief
allusion to them will suffice.</p>

<p>I went out steerage in a sailing vessel, and was brought into contact with
new phases of life and adventure. Had I been less anxious about myself and those
connected with me, I should have found ample scope for contemplation and study
in these novel pictures of human life and struggle; and even as it was, they
frequently afforded me a healthy diversion from my own private cares. My time on
board was chiefly occupied upon a diary which I subsequently sent home to Ellen,
and being written for her I took pains to make it interesting. It interested me
too, and I was amused at the importance with which trivial incidents were
insensibly invested. I was, it is true, subject to fits of depression, but the
salt breezes, the rough life, the open air, the alternations of storm and
sunshine, invigorated me, and helped to shake them off. I had with me, besides,
an infallible charm in the portraits of Ellen and our child, which I wore close
to my heart. Whenever I gazed upon these pictures Ellen&#39;s words recurred to me:
&quot;Dear love, dear love, I am thinking of you,&quot; and hope bloomed like a flower
within me.</p>

<p>At home I had given little thought to the special groove in which I should
strive to obtain a livelihood in the Colonies. I was ready and willing to
undertake any kind of work, but I was certainly not prepared for the
difficulties I encountered. The market was crowded with unemployed labor; on all
sides I heard the cry of hard times, and yet money seemed to be abundant.
Surely, thought I, there must be some place for me, a man of education, in this
great city, but this very quality of education seemed to stop the way. Gentlemen
were at a discount; bone and muscle were the staple, despite the fact that bone
and muscle were striking against capital. The wages rejected by rough workingmen
I should have been glad to accept, and had I been a bricklayer, a carpenter, or
a stonemason, I should soon have been in a situation; having no special trade to
back me, I went to the wall. After weeks of vain endeavor, I determined to go up
country and see what I could do on the goldfields. I could wield a pick if I
could do nothing else.</p>

<p>I had lived very sparingly, but my little store of money was dwindling fast,
and would, even with extreme frugality, be exhausted in a month or two. No time,
therefore, to lose in idleness. To the goldfields I set my face, tramping it
alone through the bush, seeking employment on the way, which I did not obtain.
The golden days of the Colonies were over, and the familiar and magic cry of
&quot;Rush, O!&quot; was seldom heard. Still, gold was being dug from the earth, and
nuggets were as much my property as any man&#39;s—if I could only get on the track
of them. I did not. For me Tom Tiddler&#39;s ground was nearly barren, the few
pennyweights of gold I managed to extract from alluvial soil being scarcely
sufficient to provide me with the commonest necessaries. Strangely enough,
certain qualities which should have served me in good stead tended rather to
retard me, and indeed made me unpopular with the class I mixed with. For
instance, my sobriety. I was frequently invited to drink, and my steady refusal
was regarded with disfavor, occasionally with contempt. Lucky diggers celebrate
their good fortune by &quot;going on the spree,&quot; and standing treat to one and all.
No inducement could prevail upon me to join them; I held aloof from them, and
they showed their feelings by refusing to associate with me. I regretted this
the more because as a rule they were a set of free-hearted men, whose instincts
were generous, if not exactly prudent. The consequence was that I made no
friends, which did not help me in the battle I was waging. In this fight for
fortune my greatest consolation was derived from Ellen&#39;s letters. Every month I
received from my lawyer, through the Melbourne Post Office, a packet containing
Ellen&#39;s letters, and one from himself upon business matters. His communications
were brief. There was nothing of importance to report concerning my wife; her
allowance was drawn regularly, and there was no improvement in her habits;
Maxwell had called several times, and on one occasion would not depart without
an interview, which was granted. He expressed anxiety about my welfare, and made
efforts to ascertain where I was; the information not being supplied he retired,
after indulging in mysterious threats—as to which, my lawyer said, I need not be
in the least degree alarmed.</p>

<p>Ellen&#39;s letters were longer, and I need hardly say I read them again and
again with delight. Not in one of them was to be found a complaining word;
instinctively she always took the bright and cheerful view, and I knew that for
my sake she would make light of crosses. How did her letters run? She was happy
and in good health; she was comfortable in her lodgings, and the landlady was
kindness itself; our child was wonderfully well, and was growing &quot;so big&quot; that I
would hardly know him; his eyes were more beautiful than ever; everybody noticed
them, everybody fell in love with him; it made her so proud to see people look
admiringly at him, and &quot;you would not believe the notice he takes of things&quot;; he
had learned already to lisp &quot;mamma&quot; and &quot;papa;&quot; and he sent his love to his dear
papa, and a thousand, thousand kisses; she had obtained some needlework by
which she was earning a few shillings a week, &quot;not that through your great
kindness we have not enough to live upon, but I want to put something by for a
rainy day;&quot; I was to be sure not to order her to give up the work, because she
had too much idle time on her hands, and the hours flew by more quickly when she
was fully employed; &quot;when my needle is in my hand my thoughts are always on
baby&#39;s dear father, and I am wondering what he is doing at that precise
moment—but indeed, my love, you are never out of my thoughts;&quot; and so on, and so
on. Not a detail of her domestic life which she believed would afford me
pleasure was omitted, &quot;and I hope I am not worrying you by speaking of these
small matters, but it is such a pleasure to me; I write every night when baby is
asleep and my work is done.&quot; The tender expressions of concern for my welfare
were inexpressibly comforting to me. In my lonely tent I saw with my mind&#39;s eye
the dear woman in her London lodging sitting pen in hand at her labor of love,
with baby asleep in his little crib, and everything in the humble room clean and
sweet and orderly, and I thanked God she was happy and well.</p>

<p>Things went from bad to worse with me. Driven by necessity I wandered from
place to place, and there seemed to be no rest for the sole of my foot. When I
plied my pick on the goldfields I worked as &quot;a hatter,&quot; by which is meant a man
who works singlehanded. I spent weeks and weeks prospecting for gold and finding
none. Bad luck dogged me wherever I went, whatever I undertook. I had a
reasonable longing for money—for the sake of my dear Ellen and my boy, and once
I missed a great fortune.</p>

<p>I had been compelled to part with all my belongings except a short-handled
pick. All my other tools were gone, and tent and blankets as well; not a
shilling in my pockets, but happily the best part of a cake of cavendish and a
cutty. No man knows the comfort that lies in a pipe of tobacco as a bushman
does; it has sustained the courage of many a man in as desperate a plight as I
was in on that day. I had started in the early morning for a cattle station
where I had heard there was the chance of a job, and towards evening found that
I had missed my way. Had there been such twilight as we enjoy in England there
would have been time to get into the right track, but in Australia night treads
close upon the shadows of evening. It was not the first time I had been
&quot;bushed,&quot; and I accepted the position as cheerfully as my circumstances would
permit. The night was fine, the sky was filled with stars, the air was sweet and
warm. I had camped out under more favorable conditions, but I made the best of
this, comforting myself with the reflection that I had only a few hours to wait
before I obtained a meal at the cattle station I had missed. Meanwhile I smoked
my pipe, and soon afterwards fell asleep upon a bed of dry leaves.</p>

<p>I was up with the sun, and was about to resume my search for the lost track
when my eyes fell upon a range of hills studded with quartz. I thought of the
stories I had heard of rich reefs being accidentally discovered by men who had
lost their way in the bush, and considered that it was as likely to happen to me
as to another. It is true I was hungry, but I could hold on a bit longer, and I
determined to spend an hour or two in prospecting. So to it I went, selecting
the most likely-looking hill, on the uppermost ridge of which rested a huge
boulder of quartz, which a vivid imagination might have converted into the
fantastic image of a human monster. Detaching some pieces of stone from the base
of this boulder I saw fine specks of gold in them in sufficient quantity to give
promise of a paying reef. The specks were so finely distributed that they could
only be won by the aid of fire, water, and quicksilver, and the pulverizing
stamps of a crushing machine. The discovery was therefore valueless to me in its
power to relieve my present necessities, but I marked the spot and determined to
return to it when my circumstances were more favorable to the opening of a new
reef.</p>

<p>I reached the cattle station in the evening, and to my disappointment learned
that there was no work for me. The kind-hearted people on the station gave me a
plentiful supper and a shake-down, and when I rose the next morning to continue
my wanderings I was not allowed to depart empty-handed. The life I led in the
Colonies was rough and hard, but it was studded with stars of human kindness
which I can never forget.</p>

<p>Six months afterwards I was in a position—having a few pounds in my pocket—to
visit the quartz ranges I had prospected, my intention being to mark off a
prospector&#39;s claim and set to work. Other men were before me; every inch of
ground north and south was marked off for miles, and a thousand miners were at
work. The huge boulder in which I had found specks of gold had been blasted
away, and I was informed that a wonderful amount of gold had been taken from it.
The claim upon which it had stood was the richest on the line of reef, the stone
averaging five or six ounces to the ton. A quartz crushing machine had been
erected, and was merrily pounding away.</p>

<p>With a sigh I turned my back upon the el dorado I was the first to discover.
Hundreds of other men on the goldfields have missed fortune in the same manner
by a hair&#39;s breadth.</p>

<p>I will not prolong this record of my three years&#39; sojourn in Australia. At
the expiration of this time a stroke of good fortune really fell to my share,
and then it was that I received news of an event which changed the current of my
life and led to the unconscious committal of the crime for which I must answer
to the law. On a partially deserted goldfield, where there were still a few
miners at work on claims which were supposed to be worked out, I took possession
of a shaft, and in one of the pillars I found a &quot;pocket&quot; of gold which in less
than a fortnight yielded me between fifty and sixty ounces.</p>

<p>Mammon worship is an evil instinct, but gold can bring unalloyed joy to
suffering hearts. It brought joy to mine.</p>

<p>I was sorely tempted. Longing for home, for a sight of Ellen and my boy, had
for some time past assailed me; there had been hours when I rebelled against my
lot, when it needed all my moral strength to overcome the anguish of my soul. I
had now the means to gratify my cherished desire—why should I not do so?
Debating the risks of the adventure, I was tossed this way and that, now held
back by the fear that my presence in London might be discovered by my enemies to
the disturbance of the life of peace which Ellen was enjoying, now encouraged by
my ardent wish to clasp my dear ones in my arms. The question, however, was
decided for me.</p>

<p>A mail from home was due, and I was expecting my monthly packet of letters,
which I had directed to be forwarded to a neighboring township. So anxious was I
that I set off for this township in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The mail had arrived and was being delivered. Scores of bearded men were
clustered about the wooden building in anxious expectation. Some came away from
the little window with joy on their faces, some fell back with a sigh of
disappointment. The strength of the human tie which binds heart to heart is
nowhere more strikingly displayed than on these distant shores, where groups of
rough, stalwart men hurry to the post office in the hope of receiving letters
from home.</p>

<p>My packet was handed to me, and I stood aside to open it. Ellen&#39;s budget I
put into my pocket; I could not read her loving words with prying eyes around
me. The lawyer&#39;s letter was bulkier than usual, and I tore it open. I read but a
few lines when I reeled.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold up, mate,&quot; cried a man, catching me by the arm. &quot;Bad news?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; I muttered, and the denial struck me like a spiritual blow the
moment it was uttered.</p>

<p>To some men the news which caused this shock would have brought a
never-to-be-forgotten sorrow. To me it brought release from a chain which had
galled my soul. Barbara was dead!</p>

<p>It would be the worst kind of hypocrisy to say that I felt as a man feels at
the loss of one who is dear to him. It was impossible—impossible. There are
those who deem it fitting to assume a grief which finds no place in their
hearts; it is common to see white handkerchiefs held before tearless eyes. Let
it tell against me that I neither felt nor assumed such sorrow. Equally
wrong—and at the same time unjust to myself—would it be to say that I rejoiced.
But an immense weight was lifted from my heart. Barbara was dead and I was free!</p>

<p>Yes, free to marry Ellen, to commence a new and purer life, to have a home
which I could enter without fear; a home where love awaited my coming, where I
could look in my child&#39;s face without shame, where I could show by my devotion
how deeply I appreciated the sacrifices his dear mother had made for me. To
remove the stigma which in the eyes of the world was attached to Ellen through
her association with me—to give her my name, to call her &quot;wife&quot;—was this nothing
to be grateful for? Was it for this that I should put on a mournful face and
conjure false tears into my eyes? No. Heaven had sent me relief, had proclaimed
that my long agony was over, had lifted the curse from me. It was not for me to
play the hypocrite.</p>

<p>My agitation somewhat subdued, I set myself to the perusal of the lawyer&#39;s
letter.</p>

<p>The details of Barbara&#39;s death were shocking and startling. Her depraved
habits had been the cause of a miserable tragedy. The letter stated that the
first intelligence the writer received of the event was through the newspapers,
cuttings from which he enclosed. My wife, it seems, had not removed from her
lodging in Islington where I last saw her. In the middle of the night an alarm
of fire was raised, and the lodgers in the house had great difficulty in
escaping. Barbara had not been thought of. She did not make her appearance and
no cries proceeded from her room. When she was missed the firemen made their way
to her apartment, and brought out her charred body. The fire, it was proved, had
originated in her bedroom, and it was supposed that she overturned a lighted
candle, and so caused the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Among the newspaper cuttings was a report of the inquest, which my solicitor
had attended, and evidence was given of Barbara&#39;s depraved habits, one witness
stating that &quot;she was drunk from night till morning, and from morning till
night,&quot; a statement which Maxwell declared was a calumny.</p>

<p>His sister had dreadful troubles; her married life was most unhappy, but she
suffered in silence. His attempts to bring obloquy upon me were frustrated by my
solicitor, and by the evidence of the doctors. The latter proved that she must
have been a confirmed dipsomaniac for years; the former produced receipts for
the allowance I made her. The verdict was in accordance with the evidence.</p>

<p>After the funeral, the arrangements for which were made by my solicitor,
Maxwell called upon him with a document purporting to be Barbara&#39;s will, in
which she left everything to him, including the £300 a-year I had allowed her.
Upon my solicitor suggesting that he should take legal steps to obtain what he
called &quot;his rights,&quot; he offered to compromise and to forego his claim for a
stated sum. This being scouted, he asked whether it would not be worth my while
to give him a smaller sum to get rid of him forever. My solicitor replied that
that was a matter for my consideration upon my return home, but that he should
advise me not to give him a shilling, and there the matter ended. My solicitor
said he gathered from my letters that I had not prospered in the Colonies, that
my presence at home was necessary for the settlement of my financial affairs,
and that he enclosed me a draft for £200 to defray the expenses of my passage
and outfit.</p>

<p>Ellen&#39;s letter was of the usual affectionate nature, somewhat steadier in
tone because of the tragedy which she had read in the papers. She expressed
herself most pitifully towards Barbara, whose errors were expiated by her death.</p>

<p>&quot;She is now at peace, and I am sure you will have none but tender thoughts
for her.&quot; Nobility of soul, in alliance with the tenderest feeling and the
purest sentiments shone forth in every line. It softened my heart towards the
dead; it made me solemnly grateful for the living. She said not a word about her
position and my intentions. She trusted me and had faith in me. Conscious that I
would do what it was right to do, she made not the most remote reference to our
future.</p>

<p>Our future! How brightly it spread before me! There was a new sweetness in
the air, a fairer color in the skies. How strangely, how strangely are woe and
joy commingled! Blessed with a good woman&#39;s love, with no fear of poverty before
me, I would not have changed places with the highest in the world. The money I
had capitalized to secure Barbara&#39;s allowance was now without a charge upon it,
and reverted to me. The future was assured, the way was clear, the sun shone
upon a flower-strewn path. Alas! the reality!</p>

<p>There was nothing to detain me a day longer in the Colonies; the richest
claim on the goldfields would not have tempted me to delay my journey home. I
had money enough for content, and love made me rich. I looked through the
shipping advertisements in a Melbourne newspaper. A mail steamer was advertised
to leave for London this very day; I could not catch it, and I should have to
wait a fortnight for the next. Another merchant steamer was to leave for
Liverpool in two days. I determined to take passage in it. I could get to
Melbourne in time.</p>

<p>As I walked to the telegraph office, the man who had saved me from falling
when I opened my solicitor&#39;s letter passed by and looked me in the face.</p>

<p>&quot;Better, mate?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;It was good news, then?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, mechanically, and caught my breath.</p>

<p>What if I had told him that the good news was the death of my wife?</p>

<p>From the telegraph office I dispatched three messages. One to the shipping
agent in Melbourne to secure a cabin in the outgoing steamer; the second to my
solicitor in London, announcing my intended departure from the colony; the third
to Ellen—&quot;I am coming home.&quot;</p>

<p>Wonderful was the contrast between this sea voyage and the last I had
undertaken. For the greater part of the time I think I must have been the
happiest man on board. On the first voyage I had schooled myself into
resignation and submission to my fate, and had taken but a fitful interest in
the novel aspects of life by which I was surrounded. Now they appealed to me
sympathetically, and I instinctively responded to the appeal. I chatted and made
friends. I found zest in the simple amusements of ship life. I spent many happy
hours in contemplation of the future, and in arranging the details. Ellen and I
would go to some quiet country place, where we were not known, and there we
would get married. Deciding not to live in London, we would discuss together in
what part of England we would make our home. The sunniest months of my life had
been passed in Swanage, and I would have chosen that delightful spot because of
its memories, and because it would have been Ellen&#39;s choice, had I not been
restrained by the thought of Maxwell. Although with Barbara&#39;s death his power
over me had practically disappeared, still in the circumstances of our life in
Swanage—Ellen a single woman and I a married man living apart from my
wife—Maxwell&#39;s malice might sow thorns in our path. As far as was possible, this
must be avoided. We would select some part of England where we were strangers,
where the people we mixed with had no personal experience of our past. There, in
a little cottage with a garden we would pass our days, and there I would resume
my literary labors, and under a nom de plume strive to obtain a footing in the
field most congenial to me. My adventures on the goldfields would supply me with
attractive themes.</p>

<p>In this endeavor I had no personal vanity to serve; it was simply that I
recognized the mischief of living an idle life. I would have no more wasted
days. If I did not succeed with the pen I would bring my muscles into play. I
laughed as the idea occurred to me that I might eventually become a market
gardener, a cultivator of fruits. Straightway my thoughts traveled gaily in that
direction.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the voyage I became impatient. The nearer we got to
England the greater was my eagerness to see Ellen. I was on the threshold of a
new existence, and I was in a fever to cross it. This uncontrollable desire
burnt within me to the exclusion of every other topic. I became restless and
abstracted, and I withdrew from cordial relationship with my fellow-passengers.
This mood—for which I cannot account except on the grounds of pure
selfishness—lasted a week, and then I took myself to task and endeavored to make
myself companionable; but I was not regarded with the same favor, and my society
was not courted. It taught me a lesson, and I inwardly reproached myself with
ingratitude.</p>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to mention that I still retained the name I had
adopted, and that I appeared on the passenger list as John Fletcher. Time
enough, I thought, to resume my own name when Ellen and I were married. But my
principal reason for retaining the name of Fletcher was the fear that some of
the passengers might have read the account of the fire in which Barbara
perished. Newspapers nowadays deal largely in horrors, and accounts of the fire
had been published in the Melbourne journals. Naturally I shrank from
identification.</p>

<p>The date of my arrival in Liverpool was the 30th of November, and I landed
late at night in the midst of a snowstorm. From a railway guide on board ship I
noted that a train for London started from Lime Street at midnight, and by this
train I had decided to travel to London. Fatal decision! Had I been struck down
dead in the streets, my fate would have been the happier!</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession24" href="#ch24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">It is at this point of my story that I cannot entirely trust my
memory. I am, however, sufficiently clear-minded as to the course of events up
to the moment when, in a street, the name of which is unknown to me, an attack
was made upon my life. That a watch had been kept upon my movements, and that
the attack was premeditated, I have no reason to doubt; but it is almost
incredible that hatred could be so far-seeing and vindictive.</p>

<p>As I have said, the snow was falling heavily. It was the first time I had
been in Liverpool, and I was therefore not familiar with its thoroughfares. So
inclement was the weather, and so thickly did the snow lay upon the ground, that
I could not obtain a vehicle to take me to the railway station, the two or three
cabs which were available being snapped up before I could reach them. I had no
alternative but to walk to Lime Street. There was ample time to get to the
station, and I was proof against much more serious obstacles than a snowstorm
and a gale of wind.</p>

<p>I was in joyous spirits at the prospect of soon embracing Ellen and my boy,
and I walked along (after inquiring my way at the docks) with buoyant steps and
a song on my lips. It may have been that this preoccupation of mind made me
absent-minded, or that I had been misdirected, for in the midst of my pleasant
musings a doubt arose as to whether I was on the right road. I remember stopping
by a lamp-post to look at my watch, which I had purchased before I left
Melbourne; I remember the time, five minutes to eleven, and my feeling of
satisfaction that I had nearly an hour to get to the station. But which was the
right way? There was not a person in sight of whom I could make inquiries, and
at hap-hazard I turned down the street to which I have referred. It was a
narrow, ill-lighted street, and I did not notice whether the houses in it were
places of business or private residences.</p>

<p>Suddenly, either from one of the houses or from some dark courtway, a man
rushed out and attacked me with such violence that had I been less powerful than
I am his first onslaught would have accomplished his purpose. As it was, I
grappled with him at the moment of his attack, and a furious struggle began—a
struggle for life. Maddened by the attempt to dash the cup of happiness from my
lips I put forth all my strength.</p>

<p>And here it is that memory fails me. The recollection of the salient features
of this desperate encounter may doubtless be depended upon as correct, but I can
go no further in my recountal of the issue of it. One maddening thought, I know,
was dominant throughout—the thought that I was fighting for Ellen and love.</p>

<p>The struggle must have lasted a considerable time.</p>

<p>I could not see the face of my assailant, and it is my impression that he
strove to avoid recognition; nor did he speak. We struck at each other savagely
and in silence. From first to last, so far as I am aware, not a word passed
between us. We swayed this way and that, each man&#39;s hand at the other&#39;s throat;
then I felt myself lifted from my feet—a wrestling trick—and flung into the air.
But I was up like lightning, and as I seized him again I was dimly conscious of
the sight of blood dropping on the snow—whether his blood or mine I cannot say.
It seemed to be his purpose to drag me into a house, the door of which was open,
and in this he succeeded.</p>

<p>Grappling and raining blows upon each other in the dark passage, we fell upon
the stairs, and struggling to our feet without losing our hold, continued the
contest. The only weapon I had about me was a fossicking knife in its sheath,
and this I must have drawn, as was proved by the result, though I am unable to
say whether I drew it in the street or in the house. I cannot account for the
fatal use I made of this weapon except upon the supposition that a weapon of
some kind was being used against me, and that I was prompted by a savage
instinct of self-preservation. In such an emergency a man has no time to reflect
upon the consequences of his acts; reason is lost, instinct rules. My aim was to
escape into the street, his to drag me from it—and he prevailed. At what period
of the brutal conflict we gained the landing of the first floor, at what period
we stumbled into a room, and when I dealt the fatal stroke which gave me a
frightful victory—all this is hidden from me.</p>

<p>Scores of times since that night have I said to myself, &quot;Let me think, let me
think!&quot; and vainly endeavored to follow the progress of the awful struggle. In
the moment of victory I must have received a blow which might have proved
deadly, for darkness fell upon me, and I sank to the ground in a state of
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses I found myself in an apartment lighted up by two
lamps and half-a-dozen candles. The oil in the lamps was almost exhausted. The
candles were guttering down. The scattered furniture denoted the savage nature
of the struggle in which I had been engaged. Chairs had been flung here and
there, a large table was upset; had the candles or lamps been upon it the house
would have been set on fire. Against the wall, in front of me, was a sideboard
garnished with bottles and glasses, among them a syphon of mineral water.</p>

<p>This was all I discerned in the first few moments of returning consciousness.</p>

<p>I put my hand to my face, and drawing it away found blood upon it; my other
hand and my clothes were also stained with blood.</p>

<p>This caused me to think of my assailant, whose condition could have been
scarcely worse than my own. What had become of him? Why had he left me here
without finishing his work? Was he so badly wounded that he had no strength to
kill me?</p>

<p>All was silent in the house. Not a sound of its being inhabited reached my
ears. I must fly from it directly my own strength returned, thankful that I had
come with life out of the desperate encounter.</p>

<p>Gradually my sight grew clearer, and I rose to my feet. My throat was
parched. I went to the sideboard, and pouring out a glass of mineral water,
raised it to my lips. In the act of doing this, I turned mechanically, and
brought into view that part of the room which I had not yet seen. The glass
dropped from my trembling hand, the water untasted.</p>

<p>On the floor, close to the opposite wall, lay the motionless form of a man.
This was he, then, who had sought my life, this still form, struck down by my
own hand. What I could distinguish of his clothing proclaimed him to belong to
the well-to-do classes; a silk hat and gloves, which I had not previously
observed, were on a small side table. A nameless horror stole upon me. With
slow, stealthy steps I approached and knelt by his side, unconscious at the
moment that I was kneeling in a pool of blood. There, gazing with terrified eyes
upon him, I waited for a sign which did not come. Not a breath, not the
vibration of a pulse. His arm lay across his face. Tremblingly I lifted it
aside, and let it fall with a cry of terror on my lips. The face I had uncovered
was that of my half-brother Louis! He was dead, and I had killed him! The scar
on his forehead was blood-red, and though I was guiltless of causing it, seemed
to accuse me; blood was on his face and clothes, there was a wound in his
breast—his death-blow—delivered by me whom he hated, by me, who had hated him in
life. Oh, cruel fate that made me his murderer!</p>

<p>The shock of the discovery overwhelmed me. I knew what his death meant for
me. It did not dawn upon my mind; it came in one sudden, blasting flash. All
that had gone before was light in comparison with this mortal blow, which dealt
by my own hand, destroyed beyond redemption the newly-born hopes which had
filled my heart with gladness. My dream was over. Ellen and I were forever
parted.</p>

<p>Oh, God!</p>

<p>I can hear again the echo of the cry of anguish to which I gave in voluntary
utterance.</p>

<p>Oh, God! Oh, God!</p>

<p>But of what use appeal to Him? Rather appeal to man, by whom I should be
judged; relate my story to the earthly judge before whom I should be arraigned;
hide nothing from first to last; expose the remorseless persecution, the vile
cunning, the unspeakable degradation which had made my home a hell upon earth;
state how I had only landed this night; how, passing through the street I was
suddenly attacked and had simply defended myself, as any man would have done
under similar circumstances——</p>

<p>Pshaw! Who would believe such a tale? It would be scouted with derision.</p>

<p>If an angel were to come down to testify to the truth of my story he would
not be believed. How, then, could I expect to be believed when human witnesses
would testify to the hate I bore the man whose spirit was now before God&#39;s
Judgment Seat? To hope that I could break the chain of evidence that would be
brought against me was the hope of a madman.</p>

<p>One by one the candles had gone out; the room was now in semi-darkness. I
stood in thought.</p>

<p>Whoso sheddeth his brother&#39;s blood—yes, but I was innocent of murderous
design. Why, then, should I declare myself a murderer and bring despair upon
Ellen, bring ignominy and shame upon her and our child? Life-long despair,
life-long ignominy. Every man&#39;s finger would be pointed at her. In my child&#39;s
ears would ring the words, &quot;Your father is a murderer!&quot; Better for him never to
have been born.</p>

<p>I had not myself alone to think of, to act for, Ellen could never now be my
wife, the delights of home would never be mine. But for her, a lesser evil,
though she would never realize it, was to be found in my concealment of my
crime. It would be necessary for me to keep apart from her, for in her presence
I should be continually confronted by the temptation to betray myself, to make
confession, and to do this would be to inflict upon her frightful suffering.
Sweet and patient as she was, and implicit as was her faith in me, the
duplicities I should be compelled to practice in order to prevent any meeting
between us, could not but injure me in her eyes. Setting love aside—an
inconceivable hypothesis, for I never loved her as I did in this despairing
hour—honor and honest dealings called upon me to give her the name of wife. She
would grieve that I did not make amends to her for the sacrifices she had made
for me; but far better that I should sink in her esteem than inflict upon her
the crushing horror of seeing me condemned for murder. For her sake, then,
silence and secrecy, if they could be compassed.</p>

<p>There had been no witnesses of the tragic incidents of the night. I was alone
with the dead. The silence that reigned in the house favored my design of secret
flight. If any persons resided there they must have heard the sounds of the
struggle, the stumbling on the stairs, the dashing into the room, the upsetting
of the furniture. I would make sure, however, that the house was uninhabited.</p>

<p>The oil in the lamps was nearly exhausted; but I had matches in a box which
Ellen had given me before my departure for Australia. I crept into the passage
and listened above, below. No sound. Striking matches as I proceeded I went all
over the house from basement to attic, and saw no signs of habitation. The rooms
on the ground floor had been partially dismantled, and presented the appearance
of having been used for offices, while those on the upper floors had served for
private residence, the most completely furnished apartment being that in which
Louis lay dead. I made my investigations cautiously and quietly, and kept myself
prepared for a possible attack. Once, when I was taking a match out of the box
it slipped from my hand, and though I groped for it in all directions I could
not find it. There was no time to waste; every moment that I remained in the
house was charged with danger, and I was so beset by terrors springing from the
perturbed state of my mind that the flapping of a door, the wind tearing through
the street, even the slightest sound which fell unexpectedly on my ears, set all
my nerves quivering.</p>

<p>The storm had increased in violence. Through an uncurtained window on the top
floor I saw the snow descending thick and fast, the wind whirling it furiously
onward and upward. A wild night, but I had reason to be thankful for it. The
conflict of the elements lessened my chances of being caught red-handed.</p>

<p>Standing by the uncurtained window I felt for my watch; it had not occurred
to me before to ascertain the time. The watch was gone, the chain hung loose;
but the pocket-book in which I kept my money was safe. The loss of my watch did
not induce the suspicion that robbery was the motive for the attack; it must
have been jerked out of my pocket in the course of the struggle. It was
dangerous to leave it in the house; it was more dangerous to remain. I consoled
myself with the thought that I might have lost it in the street, and that it
would be found by some person who would be satisfied to retain it without making
inquiries. In any circumstances there was no name engraved on it to prove that I
was the owner.</p>

<p>A faint scratching on the wainscot at this point of my reflections drove my
heart into my mouth. So harmless a creature as a mouse was sufficient to inspire
terror. I felt my way down to the fatal room, having no means of obtaining a
light. It was quite dark now, and my footsteps were dogged by phantoms created
by the fever of my blood. I saw the forms of struggling men, watched by glaring
eyes and haunted by formless shadows; incidents of the struggle which remained
in my memory repeated themselves with monstrous exaggeration; my brain teemed
with startling images. I must get from this house of terror quickly; in the
white snow the phantoms would fade away.</p>

<p>These imaginings did not cause me to lose sight of my purpose to avoid the
consequences of my unpremeditated crime. A dual process of thought was going on
within me, one belonging to the real, the other to the unreal world. Reason
cautioned me to arm myself against the chances of detection. Such as lay in the
stains of blood on my hands and face. The snow would serve me here. From my
blood-bespattered clothes the stains could not be removed so easily. I should
not have returned to the death-room had I not noticed an ulster coat thrown
across a chair which, in the open air, would render me reasonably safe from
observation. I groped for the chair, found it, thrust my arms into the ulster,
and buttoned it up.</p>

<p>All was still as death—and death itself, a muffled figure, my father&#39;s son,
lay outlined near the opposite wall. The deep darkness did not shut it from my
sight.</p>

<p>As I made my way to the street door my foot touched an object on the stairs.
I stooped and picked up a watch, which I put into my pocket with a feeling of
relief at a danger averted. I had a little difficulty in opening the door, and
when this was accomplished and I closed it behind me, I did not linger a moment.
Every step I took from it added to my chance of safety. Turning into another
street I bathed my hands and face in snow, and removed all traces of the bloody
conflict. The storm was now a gale; the wind tore and shrieked through the
streets, the snow, whirling furiously into my face, almost blinded me. Not a
soul was about, and I walked on unobserved, with no idea in which direction I
was proceeding. Chance favored me, for my hap-hazard wanderings led me to the
Lime Street station. I looked up at the clock—two minutes past four. I took a
first-class single to Euston, it being safer, I thought, to travel first-class
than third. My fingers were numbed, and I was rather slow in picking up my
change.</p>

<p>&quot;You had better hurry, sir,&quot; said the clerk, &quot;if you want to catch the 4:5.&quot;</p>

<p>I hurried off, followed by a porter.</p>

<p>&quot;Any luggage, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What class, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not that way, sir,&quot; said the porter; &quot;the train goes from this platform.&quot;</p>

<p>He showed me to the carriage and thanked me for the tip. I had barely time to
take my seat before the train started.</p>

<p>Being the only passenger in the carriage I could, without fear of
interruption, deliver myself up wholly to my reflections. Needless to say, they
were of the most melancholy nature. The incidents in my life which were in some
way connected with my present position, rose to my memory with fatal clearness,
and formed a chain of events which might have been forged by a spiritual agency
bent upon my destruction. An inexorable fatality had attended all my actions,
and used them as weapons against myself. In every instance the circumstantial
evidence was overwhelming; my own bare, valueless word was the only testimony of
my innocence. Additional support of this fatalistic theory was supplied in the
course of my reflections. Taking out the watch I picked up on the stairs, I
discovered that it was not my own. There was an inscription on the case: &quot;To
Louis from his Loving Mother.&quot; In the struggle Louis&#39; watch had been torn from
his pocket as well as my own, and it was now in my possession.</p>

<p>I argued out my position to a possible and logical point. As thus: The body
of a murdered man having been found in the house an hour or so after my
departure, the attention of the police was immediately directed to the early
morning trains for London. At four o&#39;clock, a gentleman, looking flurried and
anxious, had presented himself at the ticket-office and paid a first-class fare
to Euston. He was so agitated that it was with difficulty he gathered his
change. He wore a long gray ulster coat and had no luggage—not even a bag, a
most unusual circumstance. He betrayed his ignorance of the platform from which
the London train started by proceeding in a wrong direction, and was set right
by the porter; presumably, therefore, he was a stranger in Liverpool. Telegrams
were at once dispatched to the stations en route, and to Euston, to detain the
passenger unless he could give a satisfactory account of himself. His
explanation affording grounds for suspicion, he was searched, and there was
found upon him a watch with the inscription: &quot;To Louis, from his Loving Mother.&quot;
By his own previous admission, his name was not Louis. Questioned as to how he
came into possession of the watch, he gave no answer. There was also found upon
his person a leather sheath, into which a gold-digger&#39;s knife with which the
fatal wound had been inflicted exactly fitted.</p>

<p>When this damning piece of evidence presented itself to my mind,&#39; I felt for
the knife. I had left it behind me. The sheath was empty.</p>

<p>What now was left to me to do? Leave matters to chance, and in the event of
the worst not happening, protect myself by every possible means, or give myself
up to the authorities? The deed I had done was beyond recall, and would ever
stand as a black mark against me. If I could have harbored a hope of proving
that it was done in self-defense I should not have hesitated, but this was
impossible. For Ellen&#39;s sake I would adhere, as far and as long as lay in my
power, to my plan of silence and secrecy.</p>

<p>Tortured as I was, I felt relieved when I came to this final decision, and I
began to consider how to provide for my safety. To attempt to get rid of the
watch and the ulster coat would be attended with danger, inasmuch as there were
at present no other means of ridding myself of them than by flinging them out of
the window or leaving them in the carriage, and thus courting the attention I
desired to avoid. Until a safer course presented itself I must therefore retain
them.</p>

<p>But brain and body were exhausted, and I could not continue my deliberations.
Lifting the dividing arms between the seats I sank upon the cushions, and closed
my eyes in sleep.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession25" href="#ch25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The train arrived at Euston at half-past eight in the morning. It
marked an epoch in my fate. Though I showed in my manner neither haste nor
hesitation, it was with apprehension that I alighted from the carriage, with
relief that I walked through the gates, a free man!</p>

<p>The snow was falling in London as in Liverpool, but not so heavily, and the
wind was less fierce. The weather was dreary enough, and I was in wretched
spirits, uncertain what to do and where to go. But in order that my movements
should not attract observation it was imperative that my uncertainty should not
be apparent; I must act with an appearance of decision.</p>

<p>Being now in a locality with which I was familiar, I made my way to a
thoroughfare where cheap clothes&#39; shops abounded, and at one of these, the
shutters of which had just been taken down, I purchased a suit of clothes, an
overcoat, and a shirt, without trying them on, and a Gladstone bag in which I
directed them to be packed. Hailing a cab I drove to a Turkish bath in Euston
Road, and, bathing there, changed my clothes, as is not infrequently done in
such establishments. I then drove to an hotel, where I engaged a room, informing
the manager that my stay would depend upon letters which I expected to receive.
Then I breakfasted, scarcely realizing until I sat down how sorely I was in need
of food. Refreshed by the meal I retired to my room, where, locking the door,
like a criminal engaged in a desperate endeavor to escape justice, I bent my
thoughts again upon the perilous situation into which I had been plunged. Well
did I know that it was a subject which would never leave me.</p>

<p>The motive for Louis&#39; attack upon my life. Let me first fix that definitely.
I could think of no other than that of obtaining possession of the few thousands
of pounds which, through Barbara&#39;s death, reverted back to me. My own death
proved—whether by natural means or murder mattered not—and leaving (as was
rightly presumed) no will, my property would fall to my half-brother Louis and
his mother, as next-of-kin. Undoubtedly this was the motive; but in what way
information had been obtained of my arrival from Australia, and by whom I had
been tracked from the Liverpool dock to the deserted street, it was not in my
power to fathom.</p>

<p>Did Louis have an accomplice? If so, who more likely than Maxwell? The
conjecture was natural, but I soon dismissed it. Two men would have made short
work of me. Revenge and greed would have chained Maxwell to Louis&#39; side, and I
should not now be alive and comparatively uninjured. There had been blood on my
face and hands, but it had not come from me—a proof that I had not, as I
supposed, been attacked with a knife. The only weapon used in the struggle was
used by me, and it had only to be established as belonging to me to serve as
fatal evidence against me. And yet it was strange that in an attack deliberately
premeditated and thought out, my assailant should have had no weapon at his
command. There was, however, no certainty of this. Knowing; that I was a
powerful man he would hardly have trusted to his own physical strength to
overcome me. The reasonable presumption was that he had a weapon, which he had
either been unable to draw or had dropped in the scuffle. I adopted these
conclusions as facts beyond dispute. He had no accomplices, he had a weapon. The
former fact added to my chances of safety, for having confided his savage
purpose to no one, the secret was confined to his own breast. And he died
without revealing it.</p>

<p>For the deed itself I did not, I could not, hold myself any more responsible
than if I had been attacked by a wild beast. Discovered, I must bear the
consequences, but I was justified in keeping it secret, and in leaving to others
the task of detection. And, indeed, it was now too late for me to take the
initiative. My flight and the property in my possession were sufficient proofs
of guilt. Innocent (it would be argued), what had I to fear? Justice never
errs—never! What mockery! Being guilty, I had done what all guilty men do. What
could be clearer?</p>

<p>I was now afflicted with the doubt whether I had acted wisely in adopting a
policy of concealment. It is in the nature of such a labyrinth of circumstance
as that in which I was wandering never to be sure of the road, to be ever in
doubt whether the right track has not been hopelessly missed. There are no
sadder reflections than those inspired by what is and what might have been. Lost
moments—lost opportunities—if I had done this, if I had done that! So do we
torture ourselves when the fatal issue is before us. But I had chosen my course,
and it was now too late to retrace my steps.</p>

<p>I deemed it fortunate that in my cable messages to Ellen and my solicitor I
had not stated the name of the vessel by which I had taken passage home, my
intention having been to give my dear one a delightful surprise. I had time for
further deliberation, to more fully mature my plans. It would be necessary that
my lawyer should be made acquainted with the facts of my arrival, but I need not
communicate with him for a few day. My present concern was to learn from the
newspapers of the discovery of Louis&#39; body, and what was said about it. In the
afternoon I went out and bought copies of the evening papers, taking care to
show myself only in those thoroughfares where I deemed myself safe. The leading
principle of all my movements at this period was caution, and I did not lose
sight of it even in so trifling a matter as the purchase of a few newspapers. I
evinced no anxiety to read them, but put them into my pocket with assumed
carelessness, as though I were not interested in their contents. Two or three
times I fancied that I was being followed, and I put it to the test, and
satisfied myself that my fears had misled me. Returning to the hotel, I looked
through the papers in the solitude of my room, without meeting with any
reference to a Liverpool tragedy. Neither in the papers of the following day was
any allusion made to it.</p>

<p>I put the true construction upon this silence. The house in which I had left
Louis&#39; body was practically untenanted, and no indication of anything unusual
had been found in the street. But it would have been folly on my part to suppose
that the murder could remain forever undiscovered. The suspense was dreadful.</p>

<p>So several days passed by. I removed from the hotel, and took apartments in
the north of London. From that address I wrote to my solicitor, requesting him
to call upon me in the evening, and asking him to say nothing of my return home.
At the appointed hour we were closeted together.</p>

<p>After the first few words of greeting he spoke of Barbara&#39;s death, and said
it was a happy release for her and for me. He then spoke of Ellen, and I
gathered that he had formed a high opinion of her; but he made no inquiries as
to my intentions with respect to her. He asked, however, whether it was my wish
that she should not be informed of my return. I replied that I wished nobody to
know, and he promised to preserve absolute silence. If he felt surprise, he
evinced none.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you seen much of her?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Very little,&quot; he replied. &quot;Altogether, I think, not more than four or five
times. I send her her allowance every month through the post, and she sends me
an acknowledgment by return. Am I to continue to send the money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; it is hers for life, whatever becomes of me.&quot; He raised his eyes. &quot;Life
is uncertain,&quot; I added. &quot;And I shall feel obliged by your forwarding any letters
to her which I may address to your care, and by your forwarding her letters to
any address I may give you. My reasons for concealment are such as I cannot
confide to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear sir,&quot; he returned, and I observed a coldness in his tone, &quot;this is
purely a matter of business, and it is my practise never to inquire into reasons
or motives. All I have to do, as your solicitor, is to carry out your
instructions. When you ask for my advice I shall be ready to give it.&quot;</p>

<p>We then went into accounts, and he said that on his next visit he would bring
papers for my signature, which would place me in possession of the money which
had been set aside to secure my allowance to Barbara. It was in the afternoon of
the day on which this visit was to be paid that I carried into execution my
cherished design of seeing my dear Ellen. An effectual disguise was imperative,
and for this purpose I had purchased in another neighborhood a false beard which
I had no difficulty in slipping on, unobserved, in a quiet street. Thus
protected, with my overcoat drawn up to my ears, and my hat shading my eyes, I
proceeded to the house in which she resided.</p>

<p>I had to wait some time before she appeared. She came out alone, and as she
crossed the road she raised her eyes to an upper window, disclosing in that
mother&#39;s glance the room in which she had left her darling boy. She entered a
provision shop a few doors off to make a purchase, and was absent from him not
longer than five minutes. Her eye was bright, her step elastic, her face wore an
expression of content. How sweet, how beautiful she was! Oh, cruel fate, that
kept me from the shelter of her love, that held me bound in bonds I dared not
break! I groaned in agony of spirit. But she was happy—yes, happy with her boy,
and through her faith in the man to whom she had given her heart. I should have
been grateful for that; and I was; but none the less did I suffer, and sigh for
the happiness which I had hoped would be mine.</p>

<p>She left the shop, and returned quickly to the house. Is there no way, I
thought, is there no way? Could we not live together in some distant country
where there would be no fear of detection? There had not been a word in the
papers of the Liverpool tragedy; perhaps the danger was already over. I had but
to keep the secret safely locked in my breast, to keep a seal upon my lips.
Surely that could be done.</p>

<p>So ran my musings as I walked back to my lodgings, where presently I was
joined by my solicitor, between whom and myself the final accounts were soon
adjusted. Our business finished, he bade me good evening with a noticeable lack
of cordiality.</p>

<p>What cared I for that, for him, for any one in the world but my dear Ellen
and my boy? As I took up the thread of my musings my heart cried out for them.
Why should I, guiltless in intent of crime, be condemned to lifelong misery and
despair? It was intolerable—more than intolerable—more than man could bear. I
would not bear it—I would not—would not——</p>

<p>Hush! What was that? The newsboys were calling out the special editions of
the evening papers. &quot;Horrible discovery in Liverpool! Horrible murder! Extra
special! Horrible discovery—horrible murder!&quot;</p>

<p>I flew into the street, all my nerves on fire, and purchasing a paper, was
about to re-enter the house, when a hand was laid on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear old John, how are you?&quot;</p>

<p>I turned with a cry of terror, and saw Maxwell smiling in my face.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession26" href="#ch26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">In sight of this new danger I was speechless. I had no power to
define its nature or to examine it with a clear mind, but I could not resist the
foreboding that a grievous burden was added to my pack of woe. There was an airy
insolence, a light-hearted mockery in Maxwell&#39;s voice which betokened that he
had reached a haven for which he had been searching; and I knew from old
experience that this was a sign of evil.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t appear to recognize me, dear John. Am I so changed, or is it that
you have not recovered from the shock of the loss we have sustained? Our poor
Barbara! Lost to us forever. She had her faults, but she has atoned for them,
and is now in a better world. Let that be our consolation. Find your voice, old
man, and bid me welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not welcome,&quot; I said, endeavoring to keep command of myself. &quot;You
have brought misery enough upon me. No living link gives you now a place in my
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True; but dead links are stronger and more binding. How they drop away,
those who are dear to us! One burnt to death, another murdered in cold blood!&quot;</p>

<p>Everything swam before me. The paper rustled in my trembling hand; the shouts
of the newsboy: &quot;Horrible discovery in Liverpool! Horrible murder!&quot; fell upon my
ears with a muffled sound, though he was but a few yards away, charged with
dread import. I knew that Maxwell continued to speak, but I did not hear what he
was saying till he shook me by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;You are inattentive, dear John. The latest murder the newsboy is calling out
fascinates you. I see you have bought a newspaper off him; they are selling like
wildfire. All over London they are screaming—&#39;Murder, murder; horrible murder!&#39;
But you are shaking with cold. It will be better—and safer—to converse in your
room, where we can read the news you have waited for so long. How true is the
old adage, &#39;Murder will out!&#39; After you, brother-in-law. The host takes the
lead, you know. Tread softly, softly!&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with the air of one who holds the man he is addressing in the hollow
of his hand, but he was always a braggart. In the midst of my terror and despair
that thought came—this man Maxwell was always a braggart. I would hear what he
had to say, and speak myself as little as possible till he was done. Thus much
made itself intelligible to my dazed senses. So I led the way into the house,
and up the stairs to my room, Maxwell following at my heels. Safe within, he
turned the key gently in the lock.</p>

<p>&quot;We can&#39;t be too careful, John, when life and liberty are at stake. And you
would have sent me away—me, your only friend, the one man in the world who can
save you from the gallows!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak in enigmas,&quot; I managed to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense, brother-in-law—nonsense. Drop the mask; you are not in the
criminal court; the police are not yet on your track. Your voice is husky. Are
you still a teetotaller? Yes? Astonishing. Drink this glass of water—it will
clear your throat. But, as my host, you will allow me something stronger. If I
ring the bell the slavey will come, I suppose. I must trouble you for a few
shillings, John. I am in my chronic state, dead broke, as usual. Bad luck sticks
to me, but I would not change places with you for all that. My pockets are
empty, but my neck is safe. What does the paper say about it?&quot;</p>

<p>He took it from my hand, and took also the purse I had thrown on the table.
The servant had answered the bell, and was waiting in the passage. He opened the
door, and giving her money sent her for a bottle of brandy.</p>

<p>&quot;Any other lodgers on this floor, John? No? That&#39;s fortunate. The less risk
of our being overheard. What name do you go by here? Your own? No? What then?
Tush! You can&#39;t conceal it from me; I have but to ask the slavey or the
landlady. There is no need even for that, except by way of confirmation. Shall
we say Fletcher—John Fletcher? A great mistake. Will tell fatally against you if
they run you down, or if you make me your enemy. You should have kept to
Fordham; it would have been a point in your favor. Poor Louis! He wasn&#39;t half a
bad sort of fellow; but you never loved him. You almost killed him when you were
boys together, and you only waited your opportunity to finish him. Well it&#39;s
done, and badly done. I don&#39;t set myself up as a particularly moral or virtuous
party, but my hands are free from blood. Ah, there&#39;s the slavey with the liquor,
and I&#39;m perishing for a drink.&quot;</p>

<p>I kept my eyes from him while he helped himself and drank; my fear was lest
some look in my eyes should betray me; my cue was to ascertain from his own lips
the extent of his knowledge, and how he came by it. His thirst assuaged he
re-locked the door, and drew a chair close to that in which I was sitting at the
table. Then he spread the newspaper upon the table, so that the revelation I
dreaded could be read by both at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I read it aloud, John?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you please.&quot;</p>

<p>We bent our heads over the paper, and this is what I read. I copy it from the
cutting I have kept by me since that night:</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;">&quot;HORRIBLE DISCOVERY
IN LIVERPOOL.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A horrible discovery was made last night in an empty house in Rye Street,
Liverpool. A couple of years ago the house was taken on lease by a corn
merchant, who used the lower floors for storage, and let the upper floors for
residence. Five or six months afterwards the tenants left, the reason being that
they considered the building unsafe. Then the merchant furnished the first
floor, and occasionally slept there. At the end of the year he had no further
occasion for it, and he gave the keys to a house agent, with instructions to let
the whole or part of the house to the best advantage, in order that he might be
relieved of some portion of the rent, for which he was responsible. For eleven
months it remained uninhabited, and then a gentleman giving the name of Mollison
offered to take it for a month to see if it would suit him to become a permanent
tenant. The agent closed with the offer; a month&#39;s rent was paid in advance, and
the keys delivered over. It may be mentioned that Mr. Mollison was a stranger to
the agent, who saw him only once, the arrangement being made at the first
interview between them. A London reference was given, and the agent received a
reply in due course which he considered satisfactory. Meanwhile, although the
month&#39;s rent had been paid, the house seemed to remain uninhabited, no persons
being seen to enter or issue from it, but there is some kind of circumstantial
evidence that on one or more occasions the new tenant was there, either alone or
with companions, there being a back entrance in a blind alley which after sunset
was practically deserted. Candles and lamps have certainly been burnt in the
room on the first floor facing the front entrance, but these were not seen from
the street, for the reason that well-fitting shutters masked the windows, and
that over the shutters hung heavy tapestry curtains.</p>

<p>&quot;For some time past the Liverpool police have been seeking a clue towards the
discovery of a gang of coiners who were supposed to be carrying on their
unlawful occupation in that city, and two or three days ago their attention was
directed to this house, which, from its situation and circumstances, offered
facilities for these breakers of the law. A close watch was set upon the front
and back entrances, but no one was observed to enter the premises. There being a
likelihood that coiners&#39; implements, if not the coiners themselves, might be
found in the house, it was decided to break into it last night. This was done at
midnight, but no implements of any kind were found. The efforts of the police,
however, were not unrewarded, and a horrible discovery was made. In the passage
from the street door to the first flight of stairs traces were seen of some
frightful struggle having taken place there. Proceeding upstairs were further
traces of the struggle, and upon the floor of the first floor front room—the
shutters of which were closed and the curtains drawn across—was discovered the
body of a man who had been ruthlessly murdered. It was not a quite recent
murder; at least a fortnight must have passed between its perpetration and
discovery. The room was in great disorder. The furniture was thrown in all
directions, and proved the desperate nature of the struggle. Upon the face of
the victim a heavy table had fallen or been dashed, with the evident intention
of rendering the features unrecognizable.</p>

<p>&quot;That this object was accomplished will not, perhaps, increase the mystery
which surrounds the affair, for the clothes of the murdered man should provide
means of identification. No cards or documents of any kind were found upon the
body. In one of the pockets was an empty purse. A watch chain was found on the
floor, but no watch. The chain appeared to have been torn away, and the absence
of watch, money, and jewelry points to robbery. Death was caused by a stab in
the heart, but a careful search through the house failed in the discovery of the
weapon. The house agent states that the deceased is not the man to whom the
place was let, of whom he has furnished a description to the police, but he
seems not to be confident as to its correctness. From the stale remains of food
and the lees of liquor at the bottom of glasses and bottles in the apartment it
is presumed that the murder was committed thirteen or fourteen days ago,
probably on the night of the snowstorm which did so much damage in the city. The
police are busy investigating the horrible affair, which is at present enveloped
in mystery. A subsequent additional statement has been made by the house agent,
who says, though still speaking with uncertainty, that there are points of
resemblance in the body to the man to whom the house was let.&quot;</p>

<p>Maxwell finished the reading of this, to me, fatal news, before I had, and
when I looked up from the paper he was smoking one of my cigars, to which he had
helped himself from my cigar case. What now remained was to hear from him how he
had learned of my connection with the murder. He was sitting with folded arms, a
glass of liquor before him, puffing at the cigar, and with his eyes fixed on my
face.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather startling, John,&quot; were his first words.</p>

<p>I returned his gaze without answering, and so we sat for several minutes,
staring at each other. At length he spoke again.</p>

<p>&quot;I am waiting, John.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>My voice was strange to me; it was as if another man had spoken.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I thought you would like to make some comment on this newspaper report
of the discovery of the crime. I do not wish you to incriminate yourself. No
need for that. Any fool looking at you now, would jump at the right conclusion.
We know who the murdered man is; the police don&#39;t, and may never discover. It
depends upon me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon me. I hold the threads, and the evidence upon which you would be
convicted. I make a shrewd guess that there is other evidence in your possession
which would bring the guilt home to you.&quot; He rose and went into my bedroom; I
followed his movements with my eyes, and made no effort to arrest them.
Presently he returned. &quot;I have taken the liberty to look over your clothing.
There is no mistake about one article—Louis&#39; ulster. Why do you keep it by you?
Man alive, it is fatal—fatal!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know it is his ulster?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it may not be, but the last time I saw the poor fellow—let me see, it
was about five weeks ago, here in London—he wore one suspiciously like it. Of
course, it is easy of proof. Do you deny it was his?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I deny nothing; I admit nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Politic, but weak and useless. I will make another shrewd guess. The missing
watch—Louis&#39;s watch. A search warrant would probably find it on your person or
in these rooms. It may be difficult to identify unmarked clothing—I beg your
pardon, you were about to speak.&quot;</p>

<p>I drank a second glass of water to clear my throat.</p>

<p>&quot;It does not state here,&quot; I said, pointing to the newspaper, &quot;that the
clothing is unmarked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it does not, but I assume it, for if his handkerchief, or shirt, or any
of his underclothing, bore his initials, the fact would be at once made public
to expedite discovery. The reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that there are
no initials on his clothing to assist the police. A fortunate thing for you. L.
F. It would be all over the country. Some woman with whom he is connected—not
his mother—would say to herself, &#39;L. F., Louis Fordham.&#39; For the best of all
reasons the man she is interested in does not make his appearance. Away she goes
to the police, examines the clothes, examines the body, and declares the name of
the murdered man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would not his mother do this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again, for the best of all reasons. She is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My stepmother dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a doornail. You are in luck. Alive, and the body proved to be that of her
son, she would argue it out. &#39;Who was my son&#39;s bitterest enemy—who has always
been his bitterest enemy? Who but John Fordham?&#39; She would swear to bring the
murderer to justice; she would leave no stone unturned; she would hunt you down,
John; she would tell the story of your life, with embellishments, in the public
court, and make your very name infamous. Lucky for you, therefore, that she is
dead. As I was saying, it may be difficult to identify unmarked clothing, but
not so with a watch. It is almost a living witness, and found in your possession
would send you to the gallows without a tittle of other evidence. What on earth
made you run off with it, and what on earth made you leave your own behind? Your
health, John. Talking is dry work. Wouldn&#39;t you like to ask me a few questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me what you know, and how you know it. I cannot ask questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything to oblige, and in any way you please. I will a round, unvarnished
tale deliver. These are capital cigars of yours; you were always a good judge of
tobacco. Well, then, to begin, with the prefatory remark that one part of it
might be called a chapter of accidents. I won&#39;t dwell much on the past; it isn&#39;t
by any means an agreeable subject, and I am quite aware that there was no love
lost between us. But one thing I will say—I think we were all unjust to one
another, all a little too hard on one another, making the worst of everything
instead of endeavoring to smooth it over. You had provocation; Barbara had hers.
She got the idea of another woman in her head, and it drove her to excesses. You
can&#39;t deny that she was mistaken in her idea; another woman there was, another
woman there is—and then, there&#39;s the child. That sort of thing is enough to
drive a wife mad, so you can&#39;t call yourself blameless for poor Barbara&#39;s death,
because you see, John, one thing leads to another. By a process of reasoning you
might be proved to be the direct cause of your wife&#39;s death, and therefore her
murderer. No doubt you can justify yourself to your own satisfaction, and I am
not going to argue with you, but as Barbara&#39;s brother it is due to her memory
that I should say a few words on her behalf. Of course you know, through your
solicitor, that when you disappeared I tried to discover your whereabouts. You
were too clever for me, and for some time I was at fault; at length I found
out—never mind how—that you had gone to Australia. Then came the question, had
you taken the other woman with you? I found an answer to it. You had not.&quot;</p>

<p>I pause here to say all the time Maxwell was speaking he was watching my
face, as if for confirmation of certain of his statements. I did not observe it
during the interview; it occurred to me afterwards when, in a calmer mood, I
thought of what had taken place between us. He continued:</p>

<p>&quot;Of your life in Australia I know little or nothing. It is more than likely
you made a fortune there; you were always a lucky devil, with a handful of
trumps in your hand that ensured a winning game. Even now—with me for a
partner—the game is not lost. Now let us see what brought you back to England.
It was not, perhaps, because you were tired of Australian life and longed for
London pleasures, though that motive is sufficiently strong. But there was
Barbara to reckon with. What an encumbrance! Too bad altogether. (Your way of
thinking, John; it is your point of view.) By a fortunate fatality—your view
again, John—the encumbrance is removed. Barbara is dead; the road is cleared for
you. The winning game is in your hand. You lose no time; home you come—to marry
the other woman. Am I right? Silence gives consent.&quot;</p>

<p>He threw away the stump of his cigar and lit another.</p>

<p>&quot;Now begins the chapter of accidents. On the 30th of November I happened to
be in Liverpool; business called me there for just one day, and of all days in
the year just that day. In the night my business finished, and not to my
satisfaction (all my life I have been robbed right and left, but that&#39;s a detail
which will not arouse your sympathy), I walked back to my hotel in no very
agreeable frame of mind. What a night it was! You remember it, John—you will
remember it all your life. It was the most awful snowstorm in my recollection—a
record. My way to my hotel lay through Rye Street. The wind cut me in pieces,
the snow blinded me; I give you my word I could not get along. I was literally
blown back every step I took, actually and literally blown into a house the
street door of which was open when I was trying to pass it. I stood in the
passage to recover my breath, and then going to the door saw the madness of
endeavoring to reach my hotel through such a frightful storm. I did the sensible
thing.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Here is a house,&#39; thought I, &#39;the street door of which has been
accidentally left or blown open; the inmates will surely accord me shelter for
the night; if not a bed, at least a seat by the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was so nipped and frozen with cold, that after closing the door, it took
me some time to get my matchbox from my pocket and strike a light, for the
passage was in intense darkness. Then the fear came over me that I might be
mistaken for a burglar. So I called out at the top of my voice without receiving
a reply. Thinking it very strange I made my way upstairs to the first floor, and
entered a room in which there was no light. I called out again, and still
received no reply. I must make the people hear, thought I, and I left the room
and ascended the second flight of stairs. To cut a long story short, I went all
over the house, and came to the conclusion that it was uninhabited. But I had
observed in the room on the first floor signs of some person having been there,
but whether recently or not I could not judge without further examination. So I
groped back to that room, and by good luck happened to put my hand on a small
piece of candle on a sideboard. This I lighted, and you will understand how
startled I was at what I saw.</p>

<p>&quot;The furniture seemed to have been violently hurled in all directions, a
table at the further end of the room was upset, and an object which I did not
immediately distinguish lay beneath it. My first impulse was to fly from the
house; there had evidently been a desperate fight in the room, and I might be
implicated in what had taken place. Upon second thoughts I became reassured. I
could account for every minute of my time during the day and night, up to the
moment I had entered this strange house; and my curiosity led me to ascertain
the nature of the proceeding which had brought about such confusion. That done I
could proceed to the police station and report what I had seen. I will not
attempt to describe my horror when I saw the body of a dead man beneath the
table, and when, examining the mutilated features, I discovered that the
murdered man was Louis Fordham. It makes me sick to think of it. I must have
another drink.&quot;</p>

<p>He tossed off a full glass of brandy and water, and rose and paced the room.
I sat in silent agony, waiting for what was to come.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me make an end of it as quickly as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;Louis lay there
before me, stone dead. Who was the murderer? At whose cowardly hand had he met
his death? The newspaper report says that his features were unrecognizable, but
though his face, when I saw it, was dreadfully disfigured, I could not mistake
it. Then, the fortnight that has elapsed may have made some change in him; then
again, there may be some exaggeration in the report. Such sensations are always
made the worst of; newspaper writers like to pile up the agony. I searched for
some evidence that would help to bring the guilt home to the murderer. It is
curious, John, that they generally leave something behind that proves fatal. You
did. The first thing I found was the knife with which the deadly stab had been
inflicted. There was blood upon it. Now, why should the discovery of that knife
have directed my thoughts in your direction? A kind of lame explanation can be
given, but it doesn&#39;t quite account for it. Perhaps it was what we call
Providence, perhaps it was because the knife was not one which a man living in
England ordinarily carries about with him. It was such a knife as gold-diggers
use, and carry in a sheath. Do you see the connection? A gold-digger&#39;s knife.
You have been in Australia, and most likely on the goldfields. A steamer from
Australia had that very day arrived at Liverpool. That formed a sequence, which
I accepted all the more readily because I had no cause to love you. I am frank,
you see; I am always frank. I detest duplicity.</p>

<p>&quot;Continuing my search I found a watch. It was like a watch you used to wear
in happier days, but of this I could not be sure. However, as I have said, the
history of a watch can be traced. It was not such a watch as Louis was in the
habit of wearing. Still continuing my search, I found a matchbox, and on the lid
the initials, J. F. They stand for John Fordham. They stand also for John
Fletcher. Did it strike you when you assumed that name that the initials were
the same? Your having been in Australia, the arrival of an Australian vessel,
the gold-digger&#39;s knife, the watch, the matchbox with the initials, J. F.,
formed a complete chain. I said to myself, &#39;My brother-in-law, John, is the
murderer.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>He had spoken all through with zest, and as he went on his enjoyment of the
story he was relating seemed to increase. Having now reached a dramatic point he
paused again to give it greater weight.</p>

<p>&quot;What now remained to me to do?&quot; he continued. &quot;To denounce you—to put the
rope round your own neck? Undoubtedly that would have been the right course, and
had I acted upon the impulse of the moment the whole country would be howling at
you for a cold-blooded monster, who had since boyhood nursed his vindictive
hatred of his brother, and only waited a favorable opportunity to barbarously
murder him. For it was a murder of the most savage kind, John; poor Louis&#39; body
was frightfully battered and bruised. But second thoughts deterred me. You were
related to me by marriage; disgrace to you meant, in some small measure,
disgrace to me; I might, after all, be mistaken in the conclusions I had drawn;
it would only be fair, before proceeding to extremities, to give you a chance of
saying a word in your own defense; and, though it may be hard to believe, I have
really a sneaking regard for you. Upon the top of this came the reflection that
you might invent some sort of story, upon the strength of which you would give
yourself up and take the chances of the law. A voluntary surrender would go far
in your favor, and you might issue from the trial a free man, or if not free,
with a nominal punishment for manslaughter. It was perhaps foolish of me to
allow these considerations to prevail, but it was the course I adopted. So,
bearing away with me the articles which prove your guilt, I stole from the house
unobserved. The next day I was in London. A week passed by, and no news relating
to the murder appeared in the papers, nor was there any notice of your giving
yourself up. This deepened my conviction that you were the murderer. Innocence
proclaims itself, guilt hides its head. And every hour that was passed fixed the
rope more firmly round your neck in case of discovery. Then I set myself to the
task of finding you, and here you behold me with my round, unvarnished tale
delivered. I think I am entitled to ask a question. Innocent or guilty, John?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Both,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah. You have heard my story. Let me hear yours.&quot;</p>

<p>I related it to him without distortion or exaggeration. As I related the
events of that fatal night I was filled with dismay at the weakness of the only
defense I could make. Conscious of my innocence, I recognized that my silence
and concealment had made the web in which I was entangled so strong that there
was no human hope of escape. At the conclusion of my tale Maxwell shook his head
and smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;It won&#39;t do, John. You will have to invent something more plausible than
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t believe me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask yourself whether a jury would. The clumsiest lawyer would sweep away
such a cobweb. &#39;Your story true,&#39; he would say, &#39;why did you not come forward
immediately and relate it?&#39; Your answer,&#39; I was afraid it would not be
believed.&#39; &#39;Exactly,&#39; he would say, &#39;it would not be believed.&#39; I see the jury
putting their heads together; I hear the judge pronouncing sentence, &#39;to be
hanged by the neck till you are dead, and may the Lord have mercy on your soul!&#39;
No, no, John, it will not hold water. Capital cigars, these of yours; wish I
could afford to buy a box or two. Well, it may be. I am a very worldly man,
John; I sigh for the fleshpots of Egypt. You would like to know, perhaps, how I
found you out. It wasn&#39;t easy. I may thank your lawyer for the information.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he give you my address?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no. I have held no communication with him. He hasn&#39;t a high opinion of
me, I am afraid. Believing that you were in London, and that you had business to
transact with him in connection with Barbara&#39;s money, which ought to have been
settled absolutely upon her, and which, by her will, would have fallen to me—we
were very short-sighted not to have insisted upon the settlement—I kept watch
upon him, and followed him, among other places, to this house. He paid his
second visit to you this evening, but I was not sure you were here till you made
your appearance at the door to purchase a newspaper. The rest you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the first time you have seen me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The first time since you left England.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a great relief to hear this, and to be convinced—as I was—that he
spoke the truth. I was afraid he might have followed me, earlier in the day, to
Ellen&#39;s lodgings. He would not spare her; whether he intended to spare me I had
yet to learn. It was to this end I now spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Having tracked me down,&quot; I said, &quot;what do you intend to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It depends upon you, John,&quot; he answered. &quot;I am disposed to stand your
friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In what way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By keeping silence. It is just on the cards that the body may not be
identified, in which case the secret is yours and mine. If I don&#39;t appear
against you, if I destroy the evidence in my possession, you are safe.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not stop to consider. My one, my only thought, was how to secure
Ellen&#39;s peace of mind. The means were at my disposal, the opportunity was
offered to me, and I availed myself of it. It was cowardly, the confession I
have made now might as well have been made then, but I did not foresee the use
which Maxwell made of the power he held over me. He needed money; I gave it to
him. He needed more money; I gave it to him; more, and I still gave it to him.
At first I submitted to his exactions without remonstrance, but as they became
more oppressive I offered resistance. Then he threatened, and I became a coward
again. The honest course was before me and I stepped aside. At all hazards I
should have taken it, and submitted to the ordeal. Too late I see my error.</p>

<p>Alas, those fatal words—too late! How often have they wrecked life and honor
and happiness; how often have they brought misery and shame not only upon the
cowardly doer of wrong, but upon those who trusted and believed in him! And yet
it was to save Ellen and my son from the misery and shame which my punishment
would have brought to them that I did as I have done. I have no other excuse to
offer.</p>

<p>Again and again has Maxwell pointed out that the arguments he used were not
fallacious, and in this he was right. Up to the present moment the body of Louis
has not been identified. For a few weeks after the discovery of the murder the
newspapers continued to give their readers such information as was supplied by
the police—meagre and unsatisfactory enough, and leading to no solution of the
mystery—until another tragic sensation thrust it from the public mind. All this
time I have been in hiding, with Maxwell ever dogging and robbing me; all this
time I have been sending letters to Ellen in the care of my solicitor, making
false excuses for my detention in Australia; all this time I have been receiving
letters from her, every line in which proved the faith and trust she had in me,
and her confidence that what I did was right. The sweetest, the dearest letters!
With eyes over-brimming I have read and re-read them—read them with shame, with
terror, with remorse, with the distracting thought eternally in my mind, &quot;If she
but knew—if she but knew!&quot;</p>

<p>Would it have been better for me had Louis&#39; mother been alive? This
reflection has frequently occurred to me. She loved him and hated me, and this
love and hate linked us together in her mind. His disappearance would have
brought into play the full power of her malignity and love. She would have moved
heaven and earth to unravel the mystery, and I do not doubt that she would have
dragged me from the frightful haven of unrest in which I have been lurking.
Would it have been better for me? Perhaps.</p>

<p>Not much that Maxwell says deserves to be remembered, but certain words he
spoke have burnt themselves into my heart. &quot;Innocence proclaims itself; guilt
hides its head.&quot; It is not always true. Proclaiming myself guilty I protest my
innocence of evil intent.</p>

<p>And now I am ruined and a beggar. Maxwell&#39;s exactions have brought me to this
pass; all that remains is Ellen&#39;s pitiful allowance. Maxwell, by some means, has
discovered this, and has repeatedly threatened to denounce me if I do not hand
it over to him. If I were weak enough to yield he would devise some new form of
torture when that small sum was squandered.</p>

<p>It shall not be. Hope is dead; my life is desolate. Despairing days,
sleepless nights—I live in purgatory. The end has come, my confession is made.
Solemnly I declare that every word I have written is true. Dear Ellen, forgive
me, comfort me, console me!</p>

<h3>RELATED BY PAUL GODFREY, PRIVATE DETECTIVE.</h3>


<p class="p2">It is not often that a private detective—that is my occupation,
and I am not ashamed of it—takes up a case for love, but that is what I did when
I took up the great Rye Street murder. I don&#39;t deny that professional pride had
something to do with it, for any man would have been proud to be employed in
putting together the pieces of so celebrated a mystery. It was love that gave me
the command, and that is not the least curious part of an affair which filled
the newspapers for weeks, and puzzled the cleverest heads in Scotland Yard. The
way of it was this. A few years ago business took me to Swanage, where I met
Miss Cameron, her Christian name, Ellen. She and her mother (since dead) had
gone there for Mrs. Cameron&#39;s health. I was, and still am, a bachelor, and I
fell in love with Miss Cameron. I proposed and was not accepted, and I left
Swanage a sadder, but I can&#39;t say a wiser man. Proverbs and popular sayings
don&#39;t always apply.</p>

<p>In such circumstances some men are angry; others pretend not to care, and say
there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it. Others are sorry for a
week or so, and then see another girl who takes their fancy. It was not the case
with me. I knew I had lost a prize, and that it would be a long time before I
got over it. Between you and me I don&#39;t think I have got over it to this day,
and that, perhaps, is a thing I ought not to say. It is down, however, and there
it shall remain.</p>

<p>Before I bade Miss Cameron good-bye in Swanage I couldn&#39;t help saying that if
it was ever in my power to serve her I would do so willingly. I hadn&#39;t the least
idea that I should ever be called upon, and I should have called the man a fool
who said, &quot;One of these days you will find yourself engaged in a murder case
that has set all the country ringing, and in which the happiness of the woman
you love is at stake.&quot; Clever writers say it is the unexpected that always
happens. It happened to me.</p>

<p>On the morning of my introduction into the case I was sitting in my office,
idling away my time. I had nothing particular to do, and was waiting for
something to turn up in the way of business. It seemed as if I should not have
long to wait, for my clerk came in and said that a lady wished to see me. I
brisked up. Ladies don&#39;t come to a private detective for nothing. &quot;Divorce
case,&quot; thought I.</p>

<p>&quot;What name?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Name of Cameron,&quot; my clerk answered. &quot;Lady didn&#39;t have a card.&quot;</p>

<p>I jumped up, all my nerves tingling, and told the lad to show the lady in. I
didn&#39;t wait for him to do it, though; I pushed past him, and there stood Ellen
Cameron, the woman I loved and had never forgotten. I held out my hand with a
smile, and she took it with a sigh. Her sad face showed that she was in trouble;
her lips quivered as she asked whether I could give her a few minutes of my
time, and her hand was cold as ice.</p>

<p>&quot;If any one calls,&quot; I said to my clerk, &quot;I am busy.&quot; And I led Miss Cameron
to my private room.</p>

<p>&quot;You want my advice,&quot; I said, drawing a chair up to the table; &quot;sit down and
tell me all about it. How did you find me out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw your advertisement in the paper,&quot; she answered; &quot;and I thought you
would be willing to assist me.&quot;</p>

<p>The newspaper in which I advertise twice a week was on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;You thought right,&quot; I said, and would have said more if I had not observed
that her eyes were fixed with fear upon the newspaper. I looked over her
shoulder, and saw that she was gazing upon a paragraph headed, &quot;The Rye Street
Murder.&quot;</p>

<p>It will clear the ground if I give the substance of this paragraph, which I
had already read with great interest.</p>

<p>On the previous evening John Fordham presented himself at the Marylebone
Police Court, and had charged himself with the murder, stating that the murdered
man was his half-brother, that the name (up till then unknown) was Louis
Fordham, and that he had acted in self-defense. According to his tale this John
Fordham landed in Liverpool from an Australian vessel on the night of a great
snowstorm, and being anxious to get to London without delay, was walking to the
Lime Street station to catch a train. Passing through Rye Street, a man rushed
out of a house and attacked him. A desperate struggle ensued, in the course of
which he was dragged into a house and up the stairs into a room on the first
floor, where he fell down in a state of unconsciousness. When he came to his
senses he saw the body of the man by whom he had been attacked, and was
horrified by the discovery that it was his half-brother, Louis Fordham.
Distracted, and scarcely knowing what he was about, he left the house and took a
morning train to London, where, living under an assumed name, he had been in
hiding ever since. He made no disclosure of the motive which had induced him to
give himself up after this lapse of time. His statement was taken down by the
inspector; who, of course, asked him no questions.</p>

<p>This was the bare story, and I attached no credence to it, having made up my
mind at once that John Fordham was guilty, and that he had been driven by
remorse to take the last step.</p>

<p>&quot;What will be done to him?&quot; asked Miss Cameron, in a trembling voice,
pointing to the paragraph.</p>

<p>Surprised at the question I drew the newspaper away, saying it was of no
importance what became of this John Fordham, and that she had better proceed to
the business she had called upon.</p>

<p>&quot;But what will become of him?&quot; she asked again.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and to satisfy her said he would be brought up at
the police court, and would be remanded.</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will be remanded two or three times to enable the police to make
inquiries, after which he will be committed for trial.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And acquitted?&quot; she exclaimed, clasping her hands, and with such an
appealing look in her eyes—as though I were the judge who was trying the
man—that I held my breath and made no reply. The suspicion that flashed upon
me—that she had come to ask my assistance in this very murder—staggered me; but
I steadied myself, and inquired if it really was the case.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;You believe him guilty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From what is stated here I can come to no other conclusion.&quot;</p>

<p>At this she fairly broke down, and I sat staring open-mouthed at her tears
and misery. Dropping her veil over her face she tottered to the door, and was
about to leave when I stopped her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Miss Cameron,&quot; I said; &quot;you must not go away like that. You have come to
ask my assistance, and I will give it you. There may be some mystery here which
needs unraveling. I place myself honestly and unreservedly at your service. But
you must be absolutely frank with me; to enable me to serve you nothing must be
concealed—understand, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me confess, though the stronger reason for this offer was to be found in
the interest I took in Miss Cameron, in my sympathy for her, that I was urged
thereto by a less powerful motive. My professional pride was aroused by the
suggestion of a mystery which I might be the means of bringing to light. To a
man like myself, nothing more attractive could present itself.</p>

<p>She turned to me with a gasp of thankfulness.</p>

<p>&quot;I will conceal nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;You will condemn me, perhaps, but I must
not allow that to stand in the way. There is no other man I can trust, there is
no other man that can serve me, there is no other man who can prove John Fordham
to be innocent of the crime of which he accuses himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You believe him to be innocent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To believe him otherwise would be to lose my faith in the goodness of God.
This will explain all. When you have read it you will know what John Fordham is
to me, and whether there is any chance of proving his innocence. You have used
the word &#39;mystery.&#39; There is a mystery here which only a man in your profession
can solve, which only a true friend would take the trouble to solve. How
thankful, how thankful I am that I came to you!&quot;</p>

<p>She took a large packet from beneath her mantle, and placed it in my hands;
then, giving me her address, and saying she would always be at home, or would
call upon me at any time I might appoint, she left me to the perusal of the
manuscript. But I did not apply myself to it immediately, beyond glancing at the
opening words. Thinking I might be in time to see John Fordham brought up at the
police court, I posted off to Marylebone, and there I found the case proceeding.
Fordham was in the dock, a pale, worn man, with an expression on his face of one
who had undergone much suffering. He looked like a gentleman, but I did not
allow that to influence me, for I put no trust in appearances. There are men
standing high in public esteem whose faces would condemn them if they were
charged with a criminal offense; and guilt itself too often wears the aspect of
innocence. Asked if he had anything to say, Fordham replied that he hoped to be
able on his trial to make a statement, which would be accepted in extenuation of
his crime; until that time arrived he would be silent, but if he could assist
the police in any way, he was ready to do so. This unusual reply awoke within me
a stronger interest in him, and I studied his features carefully; there was
stamped upon them the expression of a man who had prepared himself for the
worst. The police asked for a remand, which was granted, and he was taken back
to the cells. As I issued from the court a cab drove up, and Miss Cameron
alighted; she had taken a four-wheeler, and was too late for this preliminary
examination. I hastened to her, and told her what had taken place.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I be allowed to see him?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>I said there would be no difficulty, but that it would be best to consult a
solicitor. She mentioned the name of one who had acted for Fordham for several
years, and I advised her to go to him. She thanked me and drove off, and I
returned to my office to read John Fordham&#39;s Confession.</p>

<p>If I were to attempt to describe at any length the impression it produced
upon me I should fail. I am very fond of fiction, and I have read most of the
leading novels of my time, but I doubt if I have ever read anything in which a
man&#39;s trials and sorrows were more powerfully portrayed. I do not speak in a
literary sense, for in that respect I am a poor judge, but the effect of this
Confession upon me was startling. I seemed to see the man&#39;s heart and soul, and
sometimes I lost sight of the fact that I was perusing a story of real life. The
kind allusion to myself and the thoughtful suppression of my name affected me
strongly, and John Fordham&#39;s description of the character of Ellen Cameron
showed me what a treasure I had lost. But I should have been a despicable fellow
to bear him any animosity for having won the love I sought, and I thought none
the worse of him or Ellen Cameron for having thrown their lots together.</p>

<p>So much for my private feelings and for the small part I had played in Miss
Cameron&#39;s life. I set them aside entirely, and threw myself heart and soul into
the mystery which surrounded the murder.</p>

<p>It was plain enough to me that the Confession was worthless as evidence; a
clever writer might have invented and written it for the purpose of exculpating
himself, and by Fordham&#39;s own admission he was a writer of great power. I had
read the articles he wrote on drunkenness, and I knew that the pictures he
presented were drawn from life. But if they were cited at his trial they would
tell against instead of for him, and would serve to discount the speech he might
make in his defense. The mystery must be grappled with in a more practical
manner, and I was the more determined to grapple with it sensibly and with as
little sentiment as possible, because, when I finished the Confession I was
convinced that Fordham was quite truthful in all he had set down. It would be
hoping too much to hope that the judge and jury would think so, but I might
succeed in discovering something that would lead to a verdict of manslaughter,
and the passing of a light sentence; and it was not altogether impossible that a
verdict of complete acquittal might be compassed. In which case what becomes of
the censure passed by Fordham&#39;s solicitor upon the class to which I belong? I
cast the word &quot;vermin&quot; in his teeth. He and others are glad enough to avail
themselves of our services when they need them.</p>

<p>Fordham says that to establish his innocence (or bring about his acquittal,
which I suppose means the same thing) a miracle is needed. Not at all. If it is
done, common sense will do it. So, to work.</p>

<p>How many persons in the drama? Leaving out Ellen Cameron, who is not
connected with the mystery, six.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fordham, John Fordham&#39;s stepmother. Dead.</p>

<p>Louis Fordham. Dead.</p>

<p>Barbara, wife of John Fordham. Dead.</p>

<p>Annette, the French maid. Disappeared. No mention of her.</p>

<p>Maxwell. Alive. Where was he?</p>

<p>John Fordham. In prison.</p>

<p>There remained, therefore, only one person upon whom there was a likelihood
of laying hands. Maxwell. I must see him. John Fordham would be able to give me
his address. I decided to seek an interview with John Fordham early in the
morning.</p>

<p>But would it be easy to find Maxwell? He was accessory after the fact. John
Fordham seems not to have thought of that. Maxwell, with better knowledge of the
law, undoubtedly thought of it. Natural conclusion—Maxwell would keep out of the
way. No reason why he should not be tracked. It was something in my line.</p>

<p>About the house in Rye street, in which Louis Fordham met his death, and the
circumstances of the fatal struggle. Was it likely that Louis alone knew of the
house and had no confederates? Not at all likely. Who were his confederates? I
put the name of one on paper—Maxwell. Good! A ray of light. Like looking through
a chink in the floor. I saw possibilities.</p>

<p>Who took the house, and for what purpose was it taken? Certainly not for the
purpose of killing John Fordham. I dismissed the idea instantly. The
confederates, even if they knew the name of the vessel in which John Fordham was
traveling, could not have known that it would arrive at such and such an hour on
such and such a day; could not have known that he would walk through Rye Street
on his way to the railway station; could not have known that a great snowstorm
would arise to cloak their proceedings; could not have timed the moment that he
would pass the house. Natural conclusion that the meeting between him and Louis
was accidental, and that during the struggle, Louis was as little aware as John
of the identity of his assailant.</p>

<p>And here I was confronted with those elements of the affair which added to
John Fordham&#39;s danger. His taking Louis&#39; ulster to hide the stains of blood on
his clothes, his accidental picking up of Louis&#39; watch, believing it to be his
own, his assumed name, and his remaining in hiding for so long a time. To all
these I had satisfactory answers, but no jury in the world would entertain them.
My hopes fell almost to zero.</p>

<p>I was setting these details down in the order of their occurrence. Of the
strange discoveries I subsequently made I will make no mention till the proper
time arrives. Before I went to bed I posted a comforting letter to Miss Cameron,
in which I said much of my hopes and nothing of my fears.</p>

<p>On the following day I paid a visit to John Fordham. He looked at me
suspiciously, and was not satisfied with my friendly professions until I related
the manner of my introduction into the business. When I mentioned Miss Cameron&#39;s
name his eyes became suffused with tears.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you expect to do for me,&quot; he asked, &quot;when my own evidence proves my
guilt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you believe yourself to be guilty of murder?&quot; I asked in return.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Would it not be a good thing to convince others of that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed it would,&quot; he said, but shaking his head at the same time, as though
it were not possible.</p>

<p>&quot;At all events,&quot; I continued, &quot;it is your clear duty to do all you can to
remove the stigma from those you love. There is a mystery to be solved; at Miss
Cameron&#39;s request I have undertaken the task—with what success remains to be
seen. If you will have confidence in me it will make the task all the easier.
Surely it is not for you to throw difficulties in the way of your friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he said. &quot;I am ungrateful. I will tell you anything you wish to
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First, as to Maxwell. Had he any suspicion of your intention to give
yourself up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will come upon him as a blow. Can you give me his address?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since your arrival in England have you never visited him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor written to him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He visited you frequently?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two or three times a week for the purpose of obtaining money from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wrote to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was there no address on his letters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did it not strike you as somewhat singular?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never gave it a thought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And of course you did not examine the postmarks on the envelopes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you destroy his letters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not all. There may be one or two in a desk in my lodgings.&quot;</p>

<p>I scribbled an order which he signed. It gave me authority to enter his rooms
and look through the desk, the lock of which he informed me was broken. He then
furnished me with a precise description of the personal appearance of Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;Your wife&#39;s maid, Annette, had another name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her full name was Annette Lourbet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any idea what has become of her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you now to take your mind back to the night of the struggle. It
appears very strange to me that in the course of the fight you should both have
ascended a flight of stairs. Much more likely to have stumbled down than up. Can
you account for it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you finally left the house, Louis Fordham&#39;s body was lying at the end
of the room opposite the door. Can you be sure of that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am quite sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The table was in the middle of the room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some significant details have escaped your notice. Do you not recollect that
in the newspaper reports it was stated that Louis&#39; body was beneath the table?&quot;</p>

<p>He started at this, and I perceived that he was becoming more interested.</p>

<p>&quot;I recollect it, but it did not strike me at the time, my mind being occupied
by but one thought. Louis was dead. I had killed him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It appears strange to you now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very strange,&quot; he answered, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;In order to argue this out,&quot; I continued, &quot;I will suppose that when you left
the house, you were mistaken in your belief that Louis was dead. Shortly
afterwards he came to his senses. Getting upon his feet he staggered about the
room in the dark till his hands touched the table. In his endeavors to reach the
door the table was upset.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that explains it.&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled at his readiness and simplicity. &quot;But the fairer assumption is that
he would have fallen upon the table, not under it.&quot;</p>

<p>He stared at me; a light seemed to be breaking upon him. In an unsteady voice
he asked, &quot;What deduction do you draw from that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That another person entered the house after your departure; that another
person hurled the table—a massive oak table, according to the newspaper
reports—upon the body in such a way as to purposely mutilate the features.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another person did enter,&quot; said John Fordham.</p>

<p>&quot;I know. Maxwell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Maxwell. He happened, as he said, to be passing through the street on
the night of the snowstorm, and found the street door open.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have read the particulars in the document you sent to Miss Cameron. Do you
believe his statement?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What reason is there for disbelief?&quot; he asked, &quot;when he was acquainted with
so many things which I thought no one knew but myself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which you thought. It would, perhaps, be more correct to say that you
accepted his statement without thinking. Mr. Fordham, it is not my habit to
throw discredit upon coincidences; at the same time I do not accept them
blindly, and I decline to accept this. In an inquiry such as this upon which I
am engaged my mind is open not only to probabilities but to possibilities;
everything humanly possible must be taken into account. Let one of the reins
slip through your fingers, and you upset the coach. Maxwell says he found the
street door open; you state that when you left the house you closed it behind
you. I range myself on your side. The street door was shut.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then to enter the house Maxwell must have had a key?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly. He had a key, and he and your half-brother were accomplices. From
your experience of them, probable or possible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probable. But this will not exculpate me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know where it will lead, but I intend to follow it up if I can. By
the way, where was your wife buried?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the Highgate Cemetery,&quot; he answered, with a look of surprise, &quot;where my
father lies. We have a family grave there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your stepmother must have been buried in that grave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very likely—but these are idle questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so idle as they seem, perhaps. Another question, more to the point.
Maxwell states that he found three articles belonging to you in the Rye Street
house—your watch, your gold-digger&#39;s knife, and your matchbox. Did he return
them to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He retained them as evidence against me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be astonished if they are ever brought against you. My impression is
that he will keep out of the way. I may not have time to see you again this
week. If you have anything to communicate—if anything occurs to you that may
assist me—write to my office.&quot;</p>

<p>I proceeded immediately to John Fordham&#39;s lodgings, where he was known as
John Fletcher, and had a chat with the landlady. She spoke in the highest terms
of her lodger; he was polite and civil, &quot;a perfect gentleman,&quot; and gave no
trouble; but she knew &quot;all along that there was something on his mind.&quot; He
always paid in advance, and there was a fortnight of his last payment still to
run. In his desk I found only one letter from Maxwell; the envelope had been
destroyed. It was friendly, and contained nothing incriminating. There was a
reference in it to &quot;low spirits&quot; from which &quot;dear John&quot; was suffering, and the
writer, who signed himself &quot;M.,&quot; could not understand why John Fordham should be
so melancholy. &quot;Cheer up, old fellow,&quot; said &quot;M.,&quot; &quot;I shall come and see you
tomorrow, and shall try to put some life into you.&quot; I understood why the letter
was so carefully worded; Maxwell was guarding himself against the chance of his
correspondence falling into other hands. Before I left the house, with the
letter in my pocket, I inquired of the landlady whether she had seen Maxwell and
had spoken to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;Mr. Maxwell is a very pleasant gentleman, and often
asked me if I knew what made Mr. Fletcher so low-spirited, but of course I
couldn&#39;t tell him.&quot;</p>

<p>Maxwell had evidently acted with great caution.</p>

<p>A few hours afterwards I got out at the Liverpool station. My business in
that city did not take me long, but it led to something of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p>In Fordham&#39;s written story of his life which he had sent to Miss Cameron he
says he is uncertain whether the man who attacked him rushed out of a courtway
or a house. There is no court near the house in which the struggle took place,
therefore that point is settled. The house is still uninhabited, and I had no
difficulty in obtaining admission. Mentally following the course of the fatal
struggle between John and Louis Fordham from the street door to the room on the
first floor in which Louis&#39; body was found, I was struck by the peculiar
formation of the staircase. There were two sharp turns in it, one of them being
nearly an acute angle. That two men striking blindly at each other, and fighting
for life or death in dense darkness, should have ascended this staircase, seemed
to me exceedingly improbable, and the doubt presented itself whether John
Fordham&#39;s account of the conflict was to be depended upon. When a man&#39;s sober
senses are at fault, he is apt to be misled by his imagination. Was it so in
this instance?</p>

<p>I examined the oak table in the room. It is of unusual size, six feet square,
exceedingly heavy, and set on four massive legs. All the pressure I could bring
to bear upon it was ineffective in tilting it, and I came to the positive
conclusion that it could only have been overturned by a powerful effort from
beneath. This proved that neither John nor Louis was responsible for the
position in which the table was found by the police. I was convinced that a
third person was implicated in the tragic affair; but though it was inevitable
that my suspicions should point to Maxwell, I did not pledge myself to it. There
might have been a fourth.</p>

<p>My interview with the agent who had let the house to a &quot;Mr. Mollison&quot; for a
month upon trial opened up the field of conjecture, and was the means of leading
to a direct clue—in fact, to two. He had seen Mr. Mollison on one occasion only,
and he gave me such a confused and bungling description of that person that I
felt it would be foolish to place any dependence upon it. In relation to this
description I put but one question to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you observe a scar upon Mr. Mollison&#39;s forehead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered, after a little hesitation: &quot;I do not think there was any
scar.&quot;</p>

<p>We then spoke of the London reference which Mr. Mollison had given him, and
he produced the letter he had received in reply to his own. It was signed &quot;R.
Lambert,&quot; and addressed, 214 Adelaide Road, N. W. From subsequent inquiries I
learned that this house had been inhabited for only a few weeks during the last
six or seven years, and then not by a person of the name of Lambert.</p>

<p>Now, I do not profess to be an expert in handwriting, but placing F.
Lambert&#39;s letter by the side of Maxwell&#39;s, which I had taken from John Fordham&#39;s
desk, a certain resemblance (by no means perfect) forced itself upon my
attention. Accompanied by the agent, I went to the office of an expert, who
partially confirmed my suspicion, but declined to pledge himself to it without a
more minute examination. I left the letters with him, and directed him to
forward them to London with his report. This was one of the clues I obtained
during my brief stay in Liverpool. The more important one (which led to a
startling result) was obtained in the following manner:</p>

<p>On our way from the office of the expert in handwriting to that of the agent,
the latter mentioned that, although he had seen Mr. Mollison only once, a clerk
in his employ had met him in the street after the house was taken. Without delay
I interviewed this clerk, who admitted that he had seen Mr. Mollison a fortnight
after the agreement was signed. Having taken no particular notice of that
gentleman, he could furnish me with no better description of him than his master
had supplied, except that he looked like a gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;Which was more than the man who was with him did,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;he was not alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; was the reply, &quot;he was walking with a friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With a friend?&quot; I said. &quot;Though one was a gentleman and the other was not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose they were friends, because they were laughing at something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did the other man look like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A common sort of man; but he was dressed well enough. I can&#39;t say he seemed
easy in his clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What made you notice him particularly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I came up to them Mr. Mollison said, &#39;You did it cleverly, Jack.&#39; &#39;Oh, I
can show &#39;em a trick or two,&#39; said the man he called Jack; and then they burst
out laughing. That made me turn round and look at the clever one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you notice in him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That his face was pock-marked, and that he had a club foot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was he tall or short?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Short.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did they see you looking at them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so, because just then they turned the other way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And did you not follow them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What should I follow them for?&quot;</p>

<p>I pressed him hard, but he could tell me nothing more.</p>

<p>All the way back to London my thoughts ran chiefly on this club-footed,
pock-marked Jack. Such a business as mine brings a man into queer company, and,
without boasting, I may say that I am acquainted with half the bad characters in
London. Some years ago I was a detective in the police force, but thinking I
could do better, I said good-bye to Scotland Yard, and started a private office
of my own. I like a free hand, and I got it and have done well with it.</p>

<p>Jack. With a club foot. A short man, who did not seem easy in good clothes.
His face pock-marked. What better marks of identification could a detective
desire? I was on the threshold of discovery, and yet some perverse streak kept
me from seeing it. Not till the train was a mile from St. Pancras did I suddenly
cry aloud—for all the world as though the name flashed itself out on one of the
advertisements in the carriage—&quot;Jack Skinner!&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, Jack Skinner. He answered the description perfectly. He was short, he
was pock-marked, he had a club foot, he was accustomed to wear fustian. I was
really annoyed with myself that I had not thought of him at once. But it happens
so sometimes.</p>

<p>Jack was his proper name. I dare say. Skinner was a nickname, bestowed upon
him for certain peculiarities by which he was distinguished. The house-agent&#39;s
clerk heard him say, &quot;I can show &#39;em a trick or two.&quot; I should think he could.
No man better. But for all that, he hadn&#39;t done any good for himself. Jack and I
were old friends. I nicked him once as clean as a whistle, and got him three
months. &quot;You&#39;re too much for me, guv&#39;nor,&quot; he said with a grin. He had a
wholesome fear of me, but it was a long time since I had set eyes on him.</p>

<p>The board was before me, with a lot of pieces on it. My next move was to hunt
Jack down. I will not waste time by relating how I did it. A fortnight it took
me before I had him under my thumb. I don&#39;t mind confessing (I didn&#39;t tell him
as much) that I was not prepared for the disclosures he made. They took me
fairly by surprise, and let a lot of light upon the Rye Street Mystery.</p>

<p>I shall let Jack speak for himself. The story he related shall be told in his
own words.</p>

<h3>JACK SKINNER MAKES A STATEMENT.</h3>


<p class="p2">Look &#39;ere. It ain&#39;t a plant, is it? I&#39;m a bad lot, I know, about
as bad as they make &#39;em, but when it comes to committin&#39; a murder, it ain&#39;t in
me to do it. If I &#39;ad the &#39;eart to kill a man, I ain&#39;t got the pluck—Wot&#39;s that
yer say? I &#39;ad a &#39;and in it? I&#39;ll take my oath on my mother&#39;s Bible I &#39;adn&#39;t. I
don&#39;t remember my mother—I wos chucked on the world wery young, guv&#39;nor—and I
don&#39;t know as she ever &#39;ad a Bible, but that don&#39;t make no difference, do it? If
she did &#39;ave a Bible, and it was afore me now, I&#39;d take my oath on it. I can&#39;t
speak fairer nor that, can I? I wos there—I don&#39;t deny I wos there when it wos
done but I &#39;adn&#39;t no more to do with it than the babby unborn. If it wos the
last word I &#39;ad to speak with my dyin&#39; breath, I&#39;d swear I didn&#39;t &#39;ave no &#39;and
in it, and I couldn&#39;t prevent it no more nor you could, guv&#39;nor, bein&#39;, as I
dessay you wos, a &#39;undered mile away at the time. Why, it come upon me like a
clap of thunder, and upon Mr. Louis, too, pore chap, and there &#39;e wos—good Lord!
I can &#39;ardly bring my tongue to say it—there &#39;e wos, layin&#39; on the flore, stone
dead, and the blood porein&#39; out of &#39;im.</p>

<p>&#39;Ere, I can&#39;t stand it no longer, I can&#39;t. From that night to this I&#39;ve never
&#39;ad a easy minute. &#39;Underds and &#39;underds of times since then I&#39;ve seed &#39;im
layin&#39; afore me as &#39;e laid that night. It wos only yesterday, while I wos
playin&#39; a game o&#39; pyramids, and the red balls wos scattered all over the table,
that all of a suddent there wos the pore chap layin&#39; on the green cloth in the
middle of a dozen large, round clots o&#39; blood. It was only a wision, I know,
like any number of others I&#39;ve &#39;ad, but it turned me sick, and put me off my
play so that I couldn&#39;t pot a ball all through the game. Never a green field I
see but there &#39;e is, layin&#39; in the middle of it, with the grass all red about
&#39;im. It ain&#39;t a pleasant sight, guv&#39;nor, is it? It sets me all of a tremble, and
over and over again I&#39;ve sed to myself, &quot;Make a clean breast of it, Jack, and
bring it &#39;ome to the man wot done the deed. You can&#39;t be &#39;ung for it, you can&#39;t,
Jack,&quot; ses I to myself, &quot;cos your &#39;and wos never raised agin &#39;im. Make a clean
breast of it, wunst and for all, and get rid of the wisions that&#39;s a &#39;aunting of
yer day and night.&quot; And now, on the top o&#39; that, you come to me, guv&#39;nor, and
ses, &quot;Yer&#39;ve got to tell me everythink, Jack, about that there murder. Prove to
me yer didn&#39;t do it, and not a &#39;air of your &#39;ead shall be touched. Scot free yer
shall go, and for wunst in your life yer&#39;ll &#39;ave the satisfaction of bein&#39; on
the right side o&#39; justice.&quot; Ses you to me, &quot;Keep yer mouth shut, and yer&#39;ll find
yerself in a &#39;ole. Queen&#39;s evidence is your game, Jack, if yer know wot&#39;s good
for yerself.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, guv&#39;nor, when I put alongside o&#39; that wot I&#39;ve read in the papers about
somebody givin&#39; of &#39;isself up for the murder, it makes me think I&#39;d best accept
yer orfer. Guv&#39;nor, I do accept it. &#39;Ere&#39;s my &#39;and. But there&#39;s somethink you&#39;ve
got to do fust. You&#39;ve got to take yer Gospel oath that yer&#39;ll be as good as yer
word, and that I sha&#39;n&#39;t be &#39;urt for wot I didn&#39;t do. You&#39;re willing? Well, take
it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s bindin&#39;, mind yer, and don&#39;t forgit yer&#39;ll be burnt in &#39;ell fire if
yer&#39;ve swored false. &#39;Ave yer got anythink else to say afore I start? I don&#39;t
want to be meddled with once I begin, &#39;cause it&#39;d be bound to muddle me, and I
should git off the track. I must tell everythink I know about myself and my pals
and Mr. Louis? It&#39;s a large order, but all right. A clean breast I&#39;ve promised
to make, and a clean breast it shall be. &#39;Ere goes.</p>

<p>There wos three of us, outside of &#39;im that&#39;s gone. Maxwell (that&#39;s the only
name I knowed &#39;im by), and Morgan (that&#39;s the only name I knowed &#39;im by), and
me. They called me Jack, and if yer don&#39;t mind I&#39;ll call the other Louis. It
saves a lot of time to drop the misters.</p>

<p>There ain&#39;t much to tell about myself up to the time I fust set eyes on
Maxwell and Morgan. I never learnt a honest trade, and in course I &#39;ad to do
somethink for a livin&#39;. I&#39;ve been a billiard marker, a race-course runner, a
ticker snatcher, a crossin&#39; sweeper (not longer at that nor I could &#39;elp, it wos
playin&#39; it so low), a tout for sharps, a decoy for mugs, a thimble-rigger, a
tipster, a nigger minstrel, and I don&#39;t know what else. Wunst I wos that &#39;ard up
that I carried a Punch and Judy for a showman mean enough to skin a flint; &#39;e
wouldn&#39;t pay me wot wos doo, so me and Toby took our &#39;ook together. There wos a
week I run arter cabs from the railway stations on the chance of a job to carry
the luggage in. Yer can&#39;t play it much lower nor that, can yer, guv&#39;nor? The
things I could tell &#39;d fill a book if I &#39;ad the gift to set &#39;em down. If I&#39;d been
eddycated up to it I might &#39;ave done well among the swells, I&#39;m that neat with
the pasteboards. I can shuffle &#39;em in any way I want, kings at top, aces at
bottom, in the middle, anywhere you like. My fingers wos made for it. Set down
at all-fours with me, and I&#39;ll tell yer every card in yer &#39;and. With three peas
and a thimble I&#39;ve earnt many a thick &#39;un. And now yer&#39;ve got my pickcher. If
open confession&#39;s good for the soul, I ought to feel comfortable about mine.</p>

<p>It wos billiards as fust brought me and Maxwell and Morgan together. I wos
marker at the Jolly Ploughboy under a false name, and when they come in I wos
practising the spot stroke, no one else bein&#39; in the room. I&#39;d made thirteen
spots, and wos well set for a run, but the minute I set eyes on &#39;em I began to
kid, and missed a lot of winnin&#39; &#39;azards. I wosn&#39;t born yesterday, yer know.
They stood watchin&#39; me a little till I laid down my cue and arst &#39;em if they
wanted a game. They looked at each other, and larfed. &quot;O-ho,&quot; sed I to myself,
&quot;&#39;untin&#39; for mugs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he ain&#39;t &#39;ere at four o&#39;clock,&quot; sed Maxwell to Morgan, &quot;we needn&#39;t
egspect &#39;im till five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s so,&quot; sed Morgan.</p>

<p>They waited till five minutes past four, but the party they wos egspectin&#39;
didn&#39;t turn up.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll secure the table,&quot; sed Maxwell, and arst me &#39;ow many I&#39;d give &#39;im in a
&#39;undered.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Ow many &#39;ll yer give me?&quot; wos the question I put to &#39;im.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; sed &#39;e, &quot;a billiard marker wantin&#39; points.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ain&#39;t been long at the game,&quot; sed I, by way of apology.</p>

<p>&quot;We want the table till seven,&quot; sed Maxwell, &quot;to play with a friend wot&#39;s
comin&#39; to see us, so you and me &#39;ll &#39;ave a game even.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll try my luck,&quot; sed I, and we set to work, Morgan bein&#39; so obligin&#39; as to
mark for us.</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s &#39;ave a bet on it,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m agreeable, as fur as a shillin&#39; goes,&quot; sed I; &quot;it&#39;s as much as I can
afford to lose.&quot;</p>

<p>It wos a funny game. &#39;E &#39;adn&#39;t taken &#39;arf-a-dozen shots afore I sor &#39;e wos
kiddin&#39;, missin&#39; easy shots, and makin&#39; difficult ones, and pretendin&#39; they wos
flukes. But I could kid as well as &#39;im, and I don&#39;t think &#39;e suspected my play
&#39;arf as much as I suspected &#39;is. We passed each other over and over agin; now &#39;e
wos a&#39;ead, now me. Morgan seemed to be amused at the game, and wos wery free
with &#39;is remarks. At &#39;arf-past four Maxwell wos eighty-two, and I was twelve
behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s make it two &#39;undered,&quot; &#39;e sed, &quot;and double the stakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; sed I, &quot;we ain&#39;t dabs either of us.&quot;</p>

<p>We went on with the game, scorin&#39; wery slow. At ten minutes to five we wos
&quot;140 all,&quot; neck and neck. Maxwell looked up at the clock.</p>

<p>&quot;Our friend &#39;ll be &#39;ere in ten minutes,&quot; sed &#39;e; and I&#39;m blest if &#39;e didn&#39;t
set to work and score fifty-eight off the balls, within two of the game.</p>

<p>&quot;Ten to one in shillin&#39;s you lose, marker,&quot; sed Morgan, when &#39;is pal
commenced &#39;is big break.</p>

<p>&quot;Done with you, sir,&quot; sed I, but I didn&#39;t like the bet a bit when I sor wot
Maxwell could do with the balls. Luckily for me &#39;e missed &#39;is last shot, a loser
off the white, and I knew it wos all up with me if I give &#39;im another chance. So
I pulled myself together, and played up in real earnest. I wanted sixty to win,
and I run &#39;em out jest as the clock struck five. They looked staggered a minute,
and then they bust out larfin&#39;, and threw me my winnin&#39;s. As I wos pocketin&#39; the
twelve bob with a innercent look (the money come wery &#39;andy jest then, guv&#39;nor)
the friend they wos waitin&#39; for pops &#39;is &#39;ead in. It was pore Louis. I can&#39;t say
I ever took to &#39;im, &#39;e wos that stuck up, but when a cove comes to sech a end as
&#39;e come to it sorftens the &#39;eart.</p>

<p>The minute I sor &#39;im I spotted wot they wos up to. Maxwell and &#39;im wos old
friends accordin&#39; to their talk, but Morgan wos a new pal, and it wos &#39;im as
tackled Louis at billiards. Louis had plenty of money to sport; &#39;e&#39;d been
backin&#39; winners, and &#39;ad pulled off a double event, two thousan&#39; to twenty. It
made my mouth water to &#39;ear &#39;em talk about it. Maxwell &#39;ad been nicked the other
way through backin&#39; losers.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot does it matter?&quot; &#39;e cried. &quot;Every dawg &#39;as &#39;is day. It&#39;ll be our turn
next.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think yerself clever, you do,&quot; sneered Louis. &quot;You&#39;ve only got to touch
a thing to make a mess of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re the clever one,&quot; sed Maxwell, but I sor &#39;e didn&#39;t like the slap.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot do you think?&quot; said Louis, rattlin&#39; the money in &#39;is pocket.</p>

<p>Morgan and &#39;im played pyramids at fust, a dollar a ball. Louis fancied
&#39;isself a bit, and they kep&#39; praising &#39;is good shots, but &#39;e wos as much a match
for the man &#39;e wos playin&#39; with as a mouse is for a cat. It didn&#39;t take me long
to see that Morgan could give Louis four balls out of fifteen, and beat &#39;is &#39;ead
off. But the way &#39;e kidded! I never sor anythink like it. &#39;E let Louis win three
games right off, and then they played a match at billiards, five &#39;undered up.
Maxwell backed Louis, and they &#39;ad any amount of larfin&#39; and charfin&#39; over the
game. It wosn&#39;t my place to say anythink; it&#39;s a marker&#39;s business to &#39;old &#39;is
tongue if e&#39; wants to keep &#39;is place. Besides, wosn&#39;t I as bad as they wos, and
wouldn&#39;t I &#39;ave won money of Louis if &#39;e&#39;d give me &#39;arf a chance? Not that
Morgan took any of &#39;is tin that afternoon. &#39;E won five pound, and so did
Maxwell, and &#39;e chuckled over it as if &#39;e&#39;d won a &#39;atful. They went away when
the game wos over, and didn&#39;t come into that billiard room agin while I wos
marker there.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t stop long, it&#39;s true. There was a devil of a row one night, and a
man who knew me rounded on me and called me a thief. While the row wos goin&#39; on
in come the landlord with &#39;is fightin&#39; potman, and I was bundled out neck and
crop. It ain&#39;t easy to get a honest living, guv&#39;nor. I wasn&#39;t flush of tin, when
I lost my situation; &#39;arf a quid was all I &#39;ad, and that was soon blooed. Then I
&#39;ad sech a spell o&#39; bad luck that it drove me fairly wild. Windsor races wos on,
and I thought I&#39;d try my luck there, so I borrowed a old pack o&#39; cards, a deal
board, and a couple of tressels, and tramped it to the course, startin&#39; in the
night to get there in time. I give yer my word I wos &#39;most starved, and as for
my togs—well, I &#39;ad to tie the soles of my boots to the uppers with bits of
string. Between the races I set up my table, and begun to show my card tricks.
Unfortunately I ain&#39;t wery good at patter, and you know, guv&#39;nor, no one better,
wot a long way that goes with a crowd. I tried to make clever speeches, but
couldn&#39;t, and the consekence wos that the day wos nearly over, and eightpence
was all I managed to screw out o&#39; the mangy lot. A tanner o&#39; that went in
&#39;ard-biled eggs, and bread, and a go o&#39; stooed eels, and there wos I with
tuppence left to take me back to London. It wos Saturday, and there wos no
chance of gittin&#39; anythink to-morrer. A tight &#39;ole, wasn&#39;t it? A life like mine
ain&#39;t all beer and skittles, I can tell yer.</p>

<p>&quot;Down-&#39;earted as I wos, I went on with my tricks, and never did &#39;em better in
all my life. But it wos no go; them as gathered round wouldn&#39;t part. I wos
beggin&#39; of &#39;em to chuck in their coppers when who should I see among &#39;em but
Maxwell. &#39;E didn&#39;t speak to me jest then and &#39;e didn&#39;t give me nothink;
presently &#39;e went away, and come back with Morgan, and they stood watchin&#39; me
shuffle the pasteboards. Then they looked at each other, and sed somethink I
didn&#39;t &#39;ear. Morgan walked off, leavin&#39; Maxwell be&#39;ind. &#39;E took me aside.</p>

<p>&quot;Yer down on yer luck,&quot; said &#39;e.</p>

<p>&quot;Never &#39;ad sech a cussed run in all my born days,&quot; sed I, showin&#39; my rags.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re clever with the pasteboards,&quot; sed &#39;e.</p>

<p>&quot;Wish I could git my livin&#39; out of &#39;em,&quot; sed I.</p>

<p>&quot;Per&#39;aps yer can,&quot; sed &#39;e. &quot;If I orfer yer a job will yer take it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will a duck swim?&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&#39;E scanned me all over, jest as if &#39;e was measurin&#39; me for somethink, and
sed, &quot;You ain&#39;t over-partickler, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me over-partickler!&quot; I cried. &quot;That&#39;s a good &#39;un. Wot sort of a job?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pickin&#39; feathers,&quot; he said, as serious as a judge.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot sort of bird?&quot; I arst.</p>

<p>&quot;Pigeon,&quot; he answered. &quot;A fine fat &#39;un.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m yer man,&quot; sed I, and then &#39;e took a card from &#39;is pocket, and told me to
call at the address to-morrer at one o&#39;clock. &#39;Is rooms wos on the fust flore,
&#39;e said, and I was to march straight into the &#39;ouse and up the stairs, and say
nothink to nobody. As &#39;e wos tellin&#39; me this Morgan came runnin&#39; up to &#39;im and
whispered somethink about a &#39;orse that wos goin&#39; to run in the next race, and
they made off together.</p>

<p>&quot;Mean cuss!&quot; thought I, for the least &#39;e could &#39;ave done wos to give me a bob
or two on account, seein&#39; the state I wos in. &#39;Owsomever, the chance of a job
cheered me up a bit.</p>

<p>When the races wos over I looked about for Maxwell or Morgan, but they wosn&#39;t
in sight, and there wos nothink for it but to shoulder my traps and tramp it to
London. Not a pleasant journey, guv&#39;nor, with the rain comin&#39; down in torrents.
Past five in the mornin&#39; when I got back, and I wos that &#39;ungry I could have eat
a brick if I could &#39;ave got my teeth in it. I ain&#39;t tellin&#39; yer this to egscuse
myself for wot I did afterwards, only I want yer to know that I wos never in my
life so desperately &#39;ard up as I was that night when I footed it from Windsor to
London through the peltin&#39; rain. I wouldn&#39;t like a dawg belongin&#39; to me to go
through wot I did, and if it &#39;adn&#39;t been for a woman givin&#39; me the best part of
&#39;er mug of corfey at a night stall at two in the mornin&#39; it&#39;s my opinion I
should &#39;ave &#39;ad to throw up the sponge.</p>

<p>The address on the card was Newman Street, Soho, and I wos there to the
minute. Up I limped—I&#39;d run a nail into my foot—to the fust flore, as Maxwell
told me to do, the street dore bein&#39; on the swing. If anybody &#39;ad opened it to
me they&#39;d &#39;ave slammed it in my face, and small blame to &#39;em, I wos sech a
scarecrow. The landin&#39; was so dark that I could &#39;ardly see, but my &#39;and touched
a knocker, and I used it free. Maxwell &#39;imself answered it, and I follered &#39;im
to &#39;is room.</p>

<p>&quot;By gum,&quot; said &#39;e, &quot;you&#39;ve got yerself up for egshibition! &#39;Ave yer spent
that twelve bob yer won of us at billiards?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me somethink to eat,&quot; sed I. &quot;I&#39;m &#39;arf starved.&quot;</p>

<p>He took a pie of some sort out of a cupboard, and I made short work of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Beer or whisky?&quot; &#39;e sed, when I wos arf way through.</p>

<p>&quot;Both,&quot; I answered, and &#39;e laughed as &#39;e put a bottle o&#39; beer and &#39;arf a
tumbler of whisky afore me. I finished the beer and put the whisky atop of it.
It warmed me, I can tell yer.</p>

<p>&quot;Now for business,&quot; he sed; &quot;but fust go into that bath room, and wash the
dirt off your &#39;ands.&quot; I got &#39;em as clean as I could, and then &#39;e sed, &quot;There&#39;s a
pack o&#39; cards on the mantelshelf. Let&#39;s &#39;ave a game o&#39; piquet.&quot;</p>

<p>I stared at &#39;im, and sed I didn&#39;t know the game.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll learn it yer,&quot; he sed. &quot;You beat me at billiards; I want to see if yer
can beat me at piquet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ain&#39;t got no money to lose,&quot; sed I.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll play for nuts,&quot; sed &#39;e with a wink.</p>

<p>&#39;E told me all the pints of the game, and in &#39;arf-a-hour I &#39;ad it at my
fingers&#39; ends, and knew as much about it as &#39;e did &#39;isself.</p>

<p>&quot;D&#39;yer want me to play on the square?&quot; I arst.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to see &#39;ow yer can palm the cards,&quot; he answered. &quot;I told yer at
Windsor yesterday that the job I &#39;ad to orfer yer wos to pick feathers. A fat
pigeon, with feathers of gold. Do yer twig?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I sed.</p>

<p>&quot;I can palm the pasteboards pritty well myself,&quot; he went on, &quot;but I ain&#39;t
allus to be depended on. Morgan&#39;s a muff, &#39;is fingers are all thumbs. &#39;Old up
yer &#39;ands. Good—as steady as a rock. Come on; it&#39;s your deal.&quot;</p>

<p>We played, and I &#39;ardly ever dealt myself a &#39;and without four aces, or four
kings, or a point of sixteen or seventeen from the ace. In less than a hour I
won nigh upon a thousand points of &#39;im. &#39;E watched me close, but &#39;e couldn&#39;t
find out &#39;ow it wos done, and &#39;e said with a sour grin that I wos the prince o&#39;
sharps, and that &#39;e wouldn&#39;t like to play me for money.</p>

<p>Then &#39;e let me into the secret. There wos a young feller &#39;im and Morgan wos
wery intimate with; &#39;e &#39;ad money of &#39;is own, and &#39;ad won more at the races,
where the three of &#39;em went together. They&#39;d won a little off &#39;im at cards, but
they &#39;ad a notion e&#39; wos gettin&#39; suspicious of &#39;em, though they wosn&#39;t sure.
Per&#39;aps &#39;e wos, per&#39;aps &#39;e wosn&#39;t. Their scheme was to introduce a fourth
gentleman who&#39;d jine the game.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re the fourth gentleman,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;Me!&quot; I cried. &quot;Why, I&#39;ve only got to open my mouth to show wot I am.&quot;</p>

<p>They &#39;ad considered that. I wos a common, ignorant man, with a good &#39;eart—I
wos to be sure to &#39;ave a good &#39;eart—as &#39;d made a fortune on the goldfields. I
wos to lose money as well as the pigeon, and that&#39;d make &#39;im less suspicious.
The difference atween me and &#39;im wos that he paid in good money and I paid in
flash notes.</p>

<p>&quot;One night,&quot; sed Maxwell, &quot;arter yer&#39;ve lost double as much as &#39;im yer&#39;ll set
down with me while &#39;e&#39;s in the room, and in an hour or two yer&#39;ll win back
double as much as yer&#39;ve lost. That&#39;ll egg &#39;im on, and &#39;e&#39;ll try to do the same
with me or you—it don&#39;t matter which—and then we&#39;ll clean &#39;im out. We&#39;ll &#39;ave
every shillin&#39; &#39;e&#39;s got. We play for ready money—no infernal cheques—and when
we&#39;ve done with &#39;im &#39;e can go to the devil. See?&quot;</p>

<p>I did see. It wos a artful plot, and like enough to turn out jest as &#39;e
calkylated.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot am I to gain by it?&quot; I arst.</p>

<p>&quot;A reg&#39;lar swell rig-out,&quot; &#39;e answered, &quot;fine togs, a gold watch and chain,
and a ring, and two pound a week to keep yerself. When the job&#39;s finished yer&#39;ll
get a fourth of the winnin&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t throw away the chance—not me! Fine togs, a gold watch and chain, a
ring, and two pound a week—why, it wos a reg&#39;lar slice o&#39; luck, with me
starving, and not knowing where to git my next meal from!</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll jine yer,&quot; said I. &quot;&#39;Ere&#39;s my &#39;and on it. Who&#39;s the pigeon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;D&#39;yer remember that friend of our&#39;n as Morgan played billiards with at the
Jolly Ploughboy?&quot; arst Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;Send I may live!&quot; I cried. &quot;If that&#39;s &#39;im we&#39;re done! &#39;E&#39;ll know me agin as
sure as guns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll eat my &#39;ead if &#39;e does,&quot; sed Maxwell. &quot;You &#39;ad a mustarsh and a pair o&#39;
whiskers, and you&#39;ve got &#39;em now. Shave &#39;em off, and slip into yer new togs, and
yer own mother wouldn&#39;t know yer.&quot;</p>

<p>He wos right. Yer wouldn&#39;t believe the difference it made in me. When I
looked in the glass I thought I wos some one else.</p>

<p>Louis never suspected, and Maxwell sed I played my part tip-top. &#39;E acted
square as fur as &#39;is fust promises went. The watch and chain wos only silver
gilt, and the ring was Abyssinian gold and sham stones, but the togs wos all
right, and so wos the two quid a week. I told &#39;im if &#39;e did me in the end when
the job was finished, I&#39;d make it warm for &#39;im.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come across some bad &#39;uns in my time, but I never come across sech a
scoundrel as that Maxwell. &#39;E&#39;d &#39;ave skinned &#39;is own mother if &#39;e could &#39;ave
made anythink out of it and if &#39;e could &#39;ave put the skinnin&#39; on a pal. For
that&#39;s where &#39;e beat us—&#39;e knew &#39;ow to make &#39;isself safe if we wos blown on.
Louis wos mad on &#39;orse-racin&#39;, and so wos all of us, for the matter of that, but
&#39;e took the cake. We went all over the country, whenever there wos any sport on,
and yer may bet yer life we never give our own names nowhere. I think that Louis
stuck to us because &#39;e wos mad to git back the money &#39;e&#39;d lost to Maxwell and
Morgan; &#39;e wos regularly pricked, and sometimes went for Maxwell like a mad
bull. But Maxwell kep&#39; cool; &#39;e only lost &#39;isself once, and you&#39;ll &#39;ear of it
presently. &#39;E couldn&#39;t keep wot &#39;e won; &#39;e dashed it down on the race-course,
and wos more orfen stone broke than not. &#39;E wos allus goin&#39; to win a pot on the
next race, and it never come off—never once. &#39;E knowed sech a lot, yer see.
That&#39;s wot&#39;s the matter with most of us. We&#39;re so clever.</p>

<p>There wos &#39;ardly a night as we didn&#39;t end up with a gamble. Louis kep&#39; on
droppin&#39; &#39;is money, and the more &#39;e dropped the closer &#39;e stuck to us. I dropped
twice as much as &#39;e did, but then it made no difference to me, one way or the
other. When &#39;im and me wos pardners agin Maxwell and Morgan, we lost four times
out of five. It wos allus settled before&#39;and if &#39;e wos to win or lose, and the
cards wos dealt accordin&#39;. If they&#39;d been dealt fair &#39;e&#39;d &#39;ave lost, but not as
much. &#39;E reckoned &#39;isself the best player in the crowd, and it &#39;appened &#39;e wos
the wust. A barn-door fowl wosn&#39;t in it with &#39;im for crowin&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;Never say die,&quot; I sed, when we wos reckonin&#39; up our losses. &quot;Luck must turn.
Maxwell don&#39;t play a bit better nor you or me. I&#39;ll git all my money back, and a
bit over, afore I&#39;ve done with &#39;im.&quot;</p>

<p>It turned out that way &#39;cause it wos part of the plot.</p>

<p>We&#39;d jest come to Liverpool, and it wos bitter weather. It was snowin&#39; all
day and freezin&#39; all night, and the racin&#39; &#39;ad to be postponed.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll finish the job &#39;ere,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>So as to keep ourselves to ourselves a &#39;ouse &#39;ad been taken near the docks;
it wos only &#39;arf furnished, but that didn&#39;t matter. Morgan took it for a month
on trial, and give the name o&#39; Mollison. The agent arst for a reference, and one
wos sent &#39;im from London, I don&#39;t know by who. We took possession without
anybody noticin&#39; us. There wos a room on the fust flore pritty well stocked with
chairs, tables, sideboard, lamps, lookin&#39; glass over the mantelpiece, and all
that. We smuggled in grog, and wine, and cigars, and when we built up a big fire
the room looked cosy and comfortable. We used to go there after dinner, and
smoke, and drink, and play. One night I told Louis that I meant to have a dash
at Maxwell single-&#39;anded.</p>

<p>&quot;We ain&#39;t lucky as pardners,&quot; I sed, &quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; to tackle &#39;im alone.&quot;</p>

<p>By that time Louis &#39;ad dropped a matter of three thousand quid, accordin&#39; to
&#39;is reckonin&#39;, and &#39;e wos mad to git it back. I never found out where the money
went to; Maxwell wos always swearin&#39; &#39;e &#39;adn&#39;t a shillin&#39;. I&#39;ll do &#39;im the
justice to say that &#39;e threw it away right and left at the races, but &#39;e never
showed us any account of &#39;ow &#39;e got rid of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Yer&#39;ll give me my revenge, yer&#39;ll give me my revenge!&quot; That wos allus
Louis&#39;s cry when &#39;e settled up.</p>

<p>&quot;Give yer yer revenge!&quot; said Maxwell. &quot;In course we will. We don&#39;t want yer
tin.&quot;</p>

<p>And perhaps the next time Louis &#39;ud win two or three pound. That wos the way
&#39;e wos led on. Maxwell knew &#39;ow to play &#39;is fish.</p>

<p>Well, Maxwell took up my challenge to play single-&#39;anded, and we set down to
our match. Louis and Morgan wos playin&#39; the same game—piquet it wos—in another
part of the room, but &#39;earin&#39; the big talk atween me and Maxwell they left off
and come to our table.</p>

<p>&quot;D&#39;yer mind my lookin&#39; over yer &#39;and?&quot; sed Louis to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; I answered. &quot;I&#39;m winnin&#39;, and I ain&#39;t sooperstitious.&quot;</p>

<p>In course I palmed the cards, but it&#39;d &#39;ave took a cleverer chap nor Louis to
ketch me. I ought to be rollin&#39; in money.</p>

<p>&quot;Rubicon&#39;d agin!&quot; cried Maxwell with a oath, dashin&#39; &#39;is fist on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep yer &#39;air on,&quot; I said with a larf as I picked up the cards. &quot;I&#39;ll give
yer a chance. What d&#39;yer say to two-pound points?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Done with you,&quot; sed Maxwell, wery eager.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Ow much &#39;ave yer won?&quot; arst Louis.</p>

<p>&quot;Count it up for me,&quot; sed I, givin&#39; &#39;im the paper where the score was marked
down.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s over a thousand,&quot; &#39;e cried with blazin&#39; eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s my night,&quot; I sed. &quot;Didn&#39;t I tell yer? I&#39;ve got &#39;im on toast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Oller when yer out o&#39; the wood,&quot; growled Maxwell.</p>

<p>We went on playin&#39;, and I kep&#39; on winnin&#39;. Over two thousand wos now the
figger. Louis could &#39;ardly keep still. There was no mistake about &#39;is bein&#39; in
dead earnest, but as for us—well, we wos all larfin&#39; in our sleeves at &#39;im. It
didn&#39;t turn out a larfin&#39; matter in the end.</p>

<p>It was gittin&#39; late, and I orfered to leave off.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot d&#39;yer mean?&quot; cried Maxwell. &quot;Do I ever orfer to leave off when I&#39;m
winnin&#39;? Let&#39;s &#39;ave six games at five-pound points. It&#39;ll take a denced sight
more nor that to break me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would yer?&quot; sed I, lookin&#39; up at Louis.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me take yer place,&quot; sed &#39;e; &quot;I&#39;ll play &#39;im for any points &#39;e likes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I answered, &quot;I&#39;ll see it out with &#39;im.&quot;</p>

<p>So we resoomed the game, and at the end I&#39;d won a matter of five thousand
pound. Didn&#39;t I wish it was real instead o&#39; gammon?</p>

<p>&quot;Now I&#39;m on welwet,&quot; sed I, grinnin&#39; and rubbin&#39; my &#39;ands.</p>

<p>&quot;Fortune o&#39; war,&quot; sed Maxwell, takin&#39; out a pocketbook stuffed with flash
notes. &quot;Who cares? My turn yesterday, yourn to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plenty more where that comes from, I &#39;ope,&quot; sed I.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t you be afeerd,&quot; sed Maxwell, &quot;if yer won ten times as much off me
yer&#39;d git every farthin&#39; of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s a comfort,&quot; sed I, countin&#39; out the money as &#39;e passed it over to me.</p>

<p>The wonder wos that Louis took it all in, but I never did see sech a migsture
as &#39;e wos. One minute &#39;e could be as cunnin&#39; as a fox, and the next as soft as
butter. There was somethink atwixt &#39;im and Maxwell I never got to the bottom of,
a sort o&#39; relationship through a sister as wos dead, and they talked sometimes
of some one abroad, and sed if they got &#39;old of &#39;im they&#39;d make it warm for &#39;im.
But all that wos nothink to me.</p>

<p>If Louis &#39;ad &#39;ad a chance of &#39;andlin&#39; the flash notes as I counted &#39;em out
it&#39;d been all up the orchard with us, but we took care that &#39;e never at any time
&#39;ad one in &#39;is fingers. &#39;E wos short-sighted, and at a little distance the
flimseys looked all right. The notes of some o&#39; the country banks, yer know,
ain&#39;t as spick and span as Bank of England paper, but there&#39; a lot o&#39; that sort
knockin&#39; about in the ring, and the bookeys pay &#39;em out free to them as &#39;ll take
&#39;em. The biggest part of the wonder wos that Louis should &#39;ave believed we
carried sech large sums o&#39; money about us. &#39;E wos jest the sort o&#39; chap that&#39;s
took in with the confidence trick, and you read of &#39;em pritty orfen in the
papers. There&#39;s more o&#39; that goin&#39; on nor people think of. For one case as comes
afore the beak there&#39;s twenty that&#39;s never &#39;eard of. If ain&#39;t a bad payin&#39;
trade, I can tell yer.</p>

<p>As I pocketed the notes Maxwell arst if I&#39;d play &#39;im another match to-morrer.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; cried Louis, all of a tremble; &quot;it&#39;s my turn now. Yer&#39;ve got to
give me my revenge!&quot;</p>

<p>The fish wos &#39;ooked.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s only fair,&quot; sed I. &quot;You &#39;ave a shy at &#39;im, Louis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will—I will!&quot; &#39;e cried. &quot;If &#39;e&#39;s game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Game!&quot; sed Maxwell. &quot;We&#39;ve seed a lot of each other, and when did yer see me
show the white feather? But I&#39;m too tired now to go on playin&#39;, I want to git to
bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrer night, then,&quot; sed Louis. &quot;It shall be make or break.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll begin at nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Agreed. At nine o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p>So it wos settled, and wot we&#39;d been workin&#39; for so long wos comin&#39; off at
last.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession29" href="#ch29">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">At nine o&#39;clock we all met together in that room, and if any one
&#39;ad seed our faces &#39;e&#39;d &#39;ave guessed there wos serious business on &#39;and. It
comes over me now to say as there wos a green carpet on the flore, and I dare
say that&#39;s the reason why I sor the wision of Louis yesterday on the billiard
table, and why it comes so orfen when I&#39;m crossin&#39; a green field. I never
noticed the color o&#39; the carpet afore that night.</p>

<p>We settled it atween us—that is, me and Maxwell and Morgan did—that when the
night&#39;s work wos over we&#39;d clear out o&#39; Liverpool immediate, and make tracks
separately for London, where we wos to meet at Maxwell&#39;s rooms.</p>

<p>And wot a night it wos! The snow wos comin&#39; down enough to blind yer, and it
wos as much as a man could do to stand agin the wind.</p>

<p>&quot;All the better for the job we&#39;ve got to do,&quot; sed Maxwell; &quot;nobody&#39;ll notice
us goin&#39; in or out.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgan and me set down at one table, and Louis and Maxwell at another. Our
chairs wos placed so as we could see the others without turnin&#39; round. We didn&#39;t
pay much attention to the game we wos playin&#39;, though we pretended to be in
earnest over it. But we couldn&#39;t keep our eyes off the other two. We wosn&#39;t as
careful as we might &#39;ave been, for all of a sudden the man as wos bein&#39; rooked
cried savagely:</p>

<p>&quot;Wot are you fellers watchin&#39; me for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We ain&#39;t watchin&#39; yer,&quot; growled Morgan.</p>

<p>&quot;You are, and yer know you are,&quot; sed Louis. &quot;Keep your eyes off me, or I&#39;ll
wash my &#39;ands of the &#39;ole crew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Ow am I to take that, Louis?&quot; arst Maxwell, speakin&#39; very quiet.</p>

<p>When &#39;e spoke like that, with the look on &#39;is face &#39;e &#39;ad then, &#39;e wos a
dangerous man to tackle.</p>

<p>&quot;Take it as yer please,&quot; Louis answered. &quot;You and me &#39;ave knowed each other a
goodish long time now, and I&#39;ve been thinkin&#39; it ain&#39;t been much in my pocket.
From fust to last it&#39;s been a case o&#39; shell out, shell out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s it, is it?&quot; sed Maxwell, getting white about the gills.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; sed Louis. &quot;Let&#39;s see. Wot am I winnin&#39;?&quot; He counted up.
&quot;Six &#39;undered. Shall we leave off?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It ain&#39;t wot we arranged,&quot; sed Maxwell, pullin&#39; in &#39;is &#39;orns. &quot;I say, you
fellers—Louis is right. We don&#39;t want none o&#39; your interference, so keep
yerselves to yerselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I&#39;ll &#39;ave no lookin&#39; over our &#39;ands,&quot; said Louis. &quot;Some people don&#39;t
mind it. I do. Stick to yer own table, and show us yer backs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wot are yer makin&#39; a row about?&quot; arst Morgan. &quot;We don&#39;t want ter &#39;ave
nothink to do with yer.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon that we turned our chairs so as we couldn&#39;t ketch sight of the other
table, and it wos only when Louis and Maxwell spoke out that we could &#39;ear what
wos goin&#39; on.</p>

<p>&quot;I sha&#39;n&#39;t be sorry when it&#39;s over,&quot; whispered Morgan to me.</p>

<p>&quot;More shall I,&quot; sed I.</p>

<p>If Louis&#39;d carried out &#39;is threat of washin&#39; his &#39;ands of us then and there,
it&#39;d been better for &#39;im. But &#39;e couldn&#39;t guess wot wos going to &#39;appen no more
nor we could.</p>

<p>We all went on playin&#39;, and sometimes the room wos so quiet that you could
&#39;ave &#39;eard a mouse walk across the flore. We wosn&#39;t surprised when Louis sed
&#39;e&#39;d won six &#39;undered; it wos part of the plot to let &#39;im win at fust. It&#39;s an
old trick, yer know. From chance words we caught now and then, we knew the luck
&#39;ad turned, and that it wos Maxwell now as wos winnin&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;That makes five &#39;undered. Eight fifty. Double the stake if you like.
Thirteen &#39;undered. Another rubicon. Twenty-four &#39;undered. Luck wos agin me last
night; looks as if it wos turning. Your deal. I&#39;ve got six from the king! Good!
And sixteen&#39;s twenty-two. And four queens, ninety-six.&quot;</p>

<p>It wos Maxwell as spoke from time to time, and we knew that things wos goin&#39;
on the way they&#39;d been planned to. Later on, from wot we could make out, Louis
got tired of piquet. &#39;E cussed the cards, and cussed &#39;is luck, and cussed the
company &#39;e wos in; and then proposed to play cribbage, the best two games out of
three, and go double or quits. Maxwell, arter objectin&#39; to sech a &#39;eavy stake,
give in, and they got out the cribbage board.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;ll soon be over,&quot; whispered Morgan.</p>

<p>I nodded, and he looked at my watch. I can&#39;t be sure o&#39; the time, but I think
it wos about eleven o&#39;clock.</p>

<p>&quot;Fust game to me,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>They went on with the second, when all of a sudden Louis cried, &quot;Stop!&quot; so
loud that we &#39;eld our breaths, wonderin&#39; wot was comin&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot&#39;s the matter now?&quot; arst Maxwell, as gentle as a lamb.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot&#39;s the matter now!&quot; screamed Louis. &quot;You&#39;re an infernal scoundrel, that&#39;s
wot&#39;s the matter. I&#39;ve done with yer—and my mother shall be done with yer. I sor
yer palm them two fives. And look &#39;ere—and &#39;ere! The cards are marked. That&#39;s
&#39;ow you&#39;ve been swindlin&#39; me all along!&quot;</p>

<p>Morgan put one of &#39;is &#39;ands on mine, and the other on &#39;is lips, as much as to
say, &quot;Let &#39;em alone. We shall make it wuss if we put our spoke in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re out of yer senses,&quot; sed Maxwell, without raisin&#39; &#39;is woice. &quot;I&#39;ve won
the money fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re a common cheat,&quot; cried Louis, &quot;and you lie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t say that agin,&quot; sed Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;You lie—you lie—you lie!&quot; screamed Louis.</p>

<p>Morgan and me both started to our feet, but we wos afraid to turn round. I
wos so scared that I wished myself well out of it, and from Morgan&#39;s face I
guessed he wished the same. No one spoke for a little while, and then it wos
Maxwell wot led the way.</p>

<p>&quot;Yer&#39;ll &#39;ave to apolergize to me for this,&quot; &#39;e sed; &quot;I&#39;ll wait till yer
cool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yer&#39;ll wait till yer in yer grave, then,&quot; sed Louis, &quot;and I&#39;ll see yer in ——
fust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are yer goin&#39; to pay wot yer owe me?&quot; arst Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;Not one brass farden,&quot; Louis answered, &quot;and I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t git back wot
yer&#39;ve robbed me of already. I&#39;ll have my revenge on yer some&#39;ow; I&#39;ll make a
public egshibition of yer. You&#39;re a blackleg and a swindler, and I&#39;ll take these
marked cards to prove wot I say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drop &#39;em,&quot; sed Maxwell, &quot;or it&#39;ll be wuss for yer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try and make me, yer blackleg!&quot; cried Louis. &quot;You low-bred thief, you shall
die in the &#39;ulks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You fool,&quot; sed Maxwell, &quot;take that for yer pains!&quot;</p>

<p>And then there come a scream that curdled my blood. Morgan and me turned and
rushed towards &#39;em, and at that moment Louis dropped to the flore with a knife
in &#39;is &#39;eart.</p>

<p>&quot;Good Gawd!&quot; cried Morgan. &quot;Wot &#39;ave yer done?&quot;</p>

<p>Them was the last words I &#39;eerd, for I run like a madman to the door, and
flew downstairs quick as lightnin&#39;. Wot I wanted wos to git out of the &#39;ouse and
&#39;ide myself somewhere. I&#39;d never been mixed up with anythink like that afore,
and I wos frightened out of my life.</p>

<p>We usen&#39;t to &#39;ave a light in the passage, so it wos quite dark; but I made my
way to the street door, threw it open, and rushed out. I &#39;adn&#39;t time to take a
step afore I found myself in the arms of a man who was just outside, and there I
wos, strugglin&#39; and fightin&#39; with &#39;im for dear life. Wot flashed through me wos
that Louis&#39; scream &#39;d been &#39;eard, and that I should be taken up for murder. The
man I wos fightin&#39; with sed somethink under &#39;is breath, but I didn&#39;t ketch the
words. I struck into &#39;im, and &#39;e struck into me, and the snow seemed to be the
color o&#39; blood. Then &#39;e dragged me back into the passage, and we went on
fightin&#39; like wild cats. &#39;Ow long it lasted I can&#39;t say. My &#39;and was on &#39;is
throat, and &#39;is &#39;and on mine, and there we kep&#39; on tearing at each other in the
dark passage till I &#39;eerd &#39;im give a groan. Then I flung &#39;im off, and &#39;e fell
agin the stairs, I think, and laid there quiet.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t stop, yer may bet yer life. The minute I wos free I run out of the
&#39;ouse and through the snow, as if a &#39;undered devils wos at my &#39;eels. The next
thing that I remember wos that I wos at the railway station, taking a third
class for London.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I know about it, guv&#39;nor. Wot I&#39;ve sed I&#39;ll swear to. It&#39;s the
truth, the &#39;ole truth, and nothink but the truth, so &#39;elp me Gawd!</p>

<h3>PAUL GODFREY, PRIVATE DETECTIVE, CONTINUES HIS<br />
NARRATIVE.</h3>


<p class="2">I did not doubt it. I believed every word that dropped from Jack&#39;s
lips, and it set me thinking. The extraordinary turn which his disclosure had
given to the Mystery opened up so many channels of conjecture, some of which
would assuredly be misleading and likely to throw a man off the track, that I
recognized the imperative necessity of proceeding with the utmost care. To avoid
falling into a pit of confusion, system was no less necessary; the threads must
be disentangled; Jack&#39;s statement and John Fordham&#39;s Confession must be studied
and compared and discrepancies accounted for, not by the light of any
extraordinary agency, but by that of common sense; and when all this was done
the principal difficulties had yet to be encountered. There were many doors in
the Mystery, two or three of which were now either quite or partially open; the
others were locked, and it was for me to find the keys.</p>

<p>Partly for John Fordham&#39;s sake, and chiefly for the sake of Miss Cameron, I
was elated by the discovery that it was not he who had killed his half-brother
Louis. It gave me the greatest pleasure to think of the exquisite feeling of
relief she would experience when I supplied her with proof of his
innocence—sufficient for her and for me, but not sufficient, perhaps, in a legal
sense. Considering the feelings I entertained for Ellen Cameron, it may appear
strange that I should have become so zealous in the cause of the man who had
supplanted me, but there is nothing in the world so enthralling as the gradual
unfolding of a mystery such as this; there is no task so absorbing as that of
following it up step by step, and of at length piercing the darkness which at
first seemed impenetrable. There are higher callings than mine, but I doubt if
there are any more interesting; and if you think it is one which does not demand
fine powers of reasoning, as well as the exercise of physical courage, you are
greatly mistaken. As for the hold it has upon the public, there is no question
about that. It is easily to be accounted for. If a simple puzzle which is sold
in the streets for a penny will interest thousands of &#39;people, how much more so
will a puzzle so intricate and mysterious upon the unraveling of which the lives
and happiness of human beings depend? You may run us down as much as you like (I
have just been reading something of the kind), but you can&#39;t do without us, and
will never be able to; and without us, many and many a wrong would never be
righted. And after all, what are your finest lawyers, and judges, and Lord Chief
Justices but a superior kind of detective? There are black sheep among us, and
there are black sheep among them. There are black sheep everywhere. So, having
had my say, I will go on with my story.</p>

<p>To my mind, nothing was more natural than the encounter between John Fordham
and Jack, nothing more natural than the instantaneous conclusions drawn by the
combatants—Jack believing his antagonist to be an officer of the law, and
Fordham believing his to be a ruffian, bent upon robbery or murder. In many
respects Jack&#39;s disclosures corroborated the account written by Fordham, but
there were important gaps that required to be filled in. Jack did not admit any
lapses of memory; he went straight on from beginning to end without hesitation.
Fordham was less confident, and his admission of a failure of memory at a vital
point of his story would lead to the presumption that his memory was not to be
depended upon in other points. Whether judge and jury would accept Jack&#39;s
evidence with as much faith as I did remained to be seen. He was a tainted
witness, and an accessory to the fact of the murder. Then, again, I had pledged
myself that he should not be harmed. If he were brought forward in the present
position of the case he would certainly come to grief. For a time, therefore, he
must be kept in the background. Only through the principal being charged with
the crime could he be accepted as Queen&#39;s evidence, and even then his statements
would require corroboration. Morgan could corroborate them, but would he, being
himself in danger? And before Morgan could be produced, he had to be found.
Maxwell, also. It was not likely that either of them would present himself of
his own accord. Well, they must be hunted down.</p>

<p>Before I left Jack I questioned him upon various matters, testing him, as it
were, and putting him in the witness-box. There was one statement especially
which emphatically needed confirmation or refutation, and this I did not
introduce till the end. There was no prevarication in his answers; his
description of Louis&#39; personal appearance, with the scar on his forehead which
flushed and reddened when he was excited, tallied with that given by Fordham,
and he adhered unflinchingly to his account of the last scene of the tragedy. A
few of my questions were such as would be put to him in the witness-box under
the fire of cross-examination.</p>

<p>&quot;You say your back was turned during the altercation between Louis and
Maxwell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Morgan&#39;s also?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You heard them threaten each other!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you heard a scream?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And turning, saw Louis fall to the ground with a knife sticking in him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you did not see the blow struck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It might have been done by himself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, look &#39;ere, guv&#39;nor,&quot; said Jack, slipping out of the imaginary
witness-box, &quot;is that likely?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not, Jack? I will put it in this way. They quarrel and threaten each
other. &#39;You low-bred thief,&#39; cries Louis, &#39;you shall die in the hulks!&#39; &#39;You
fool,&#39; cries Maxwell, &#39;take that for your pains!&#39; And he lets drive with his
fist at Louis&#39; face. At that precise moment Louis, with a knife in his hand,
makes a drive at Maxwell. The collision diverts his aim, and the knife is jammed
into his own breast instead of Maxwell&#39;s. How does that strike you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It won&#39;t wash,&quot; answered Jack, &quot;&#39;cause I say it wos the other way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you say! You&#39;re a creditable kind of witness, you are—such a
respectable character—you can show such a clean record, you can—and as for
telling a dozen or two lies, who would believe you capable of such a thing,
Jack?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All very true, guv&#39;nor, wuss luck—but it don&#39;t make black white, &#39;cause I&#39;m
a wrong &#39;un.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t it? There&#39;s no telling what a smart lawyer can do with a witness
like you in the box. You&#39;d twist and squirm like a skinned eel. But we&#39;ll pass
that for the present, and come to something more important. You say that at the
commencement of the quarrel Louis cried, &#39;I&#39;ve done with you, and my mother
shall be done with you.&#39; Are you positive he said just those words? Be very
careful about this, Jack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If &#39;e didn&#39;t say jest them words,&quot; Jack replied, &quot;&#39;e sed somethink so near
to &#39;em that yer couldn&#39;t tell the difference. But I don&#39;t see wot&#39;s that got to
do with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn&#39;t for you to see. Make up your mind to one thing—that I know a good
deal more about the affair than you do. You are positive he said, &#39;My mother
shall be done with you?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll swear to it, guv&#39;nor. Wot should I &#39;ave knowed about &#39;is mother if &#39;e
&#39;adn&#39;t spoke about &#39;er, &#39;isself? &#39;Ow wos I to guess &#39;e &#39;ad a mother when I
didn&#39;t know who &#39;e wos or where &#39;e come from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That seems conclusive,&quot; I said. &quot;By the way, did you happen to hear Maxwell
or Louis mention the name of Annette?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not as I remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Annette Lourbet,&quot; I said, to jog his memory. &quot;A Frenchwoman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, guv&#39;nor, I never &#39;eerd the name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. What are you doing for a living just now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m doin&#39; anythink pertic&#39;lar. Pickin&#39; it up any&#39;ow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, look here, I can put something in your way. I want you to keep your
eyes open and to go about London—especially about the suburbs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wot&#39;s the little game, guv&#39;nor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be a dull boy, Jack. You might come across Maxwell or Morgan. I&#39;d like
particularly to have a little chat with Maxwell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn&#39;t mind it myself,&quot; said Jack, with a kind of growl.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I understand you have seen either of them since you left Liverpool?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never set eyes on &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As to the best chance of coming across them now? Can you suggest anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To keep on the trot, in course,&quot; he said, reflectively. &quot;But it ain&#39;t to be
done by a man like me without a object. If I went about without a object the
coppers &#39;d say, &#39;Allo! Wot&#39;s &#39;e up to?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally. But if you kept on the trot with an object, they wouldn&#39;t think
of following you. Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, they&#39;d let me alone. There&#39;s one way it&#39;s to be done, guv&#39;nor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Name it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A barrer, with or without a moke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And on the barrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Flowers in pots, all a&#39;blowin&#39; and a&#39;growin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Capital,&quot; I said, admiringly. &quot;How much would the stock-in-trade cost?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The barrer and moke could be &#39;ired by the day. Yer&#39;d go as fur as a moke,
guv&#39;nor, wouldn&#39;t yer? It&#39;s killin&#39; work draggin&#39; a barrer full o&#39; flower pots
up and down &#39;ill. There&#39;s &#39;Ampstead way, now. Think o&#39; wot it means, from Coven&#39;
Garden to &#39;Ampstead &#39;Eath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d go as far as a moke, Jack.&quot; His face brightened. &quot;And the flowers would
cost?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A thick &#39;un &#39;d do it, guv&#39;nor, and I don&#39;t know but wot it wouldn&#39;t pay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us hope it will. Here&#39;s twenty-five shillings to set you up.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave him the money and my address, and telling him to call upon me at the
end of the week, or earlier if he had anything to communicate, I bade him good
day—with an impression that he was really pleased at the prospect of earning an
honest livelihood. As he himself had pathetically said, such a life as his
wasn&#39;t all beer and skittles.</p>

<p>Let me state here why I was so anxious with respect to his allusion to his
mother which, according to Jack, was made by Louis during his quarrel with
Maxwell. The apparently unimportant words, &quot;My mother shall be done with you,&quot;
assumed intense significance when placed side by side with the information
volunteered by Maxwell a fortnight afterwards, that John Fordham&#39;s stepmother
was dead. Jack, being unacquainted with Louis&#39; family connections, could not
have invented Louis&#39; mother—therefore the words were certainly spoken by Louis,
establishing without a shadow of a doubt that at that time his mother was
living. Only a fortnight intervened before Maxwell declared that she was dead. I
dismiss the hypothesis that the woman—I will not call her a lady—died during the
interval. Setting that aside, I come face to face with the question, &quot;For what
reason did Maxwell wish John Fordham to believe that his stepmother was dead?&quot;</p>

<p>I was fairly puzzled; I could find no answer to the question.</p>

<p>Next, I turned my attention to a consideration of the state and progress of
affairs when Jack, in a frenzy of fear, rushed from the house in which the
murder was committed. The fight between him and Fordham is going on in the
street; the street door is dashed open and the combatants stumble into the
passage, where the savage conflict is continued. In the room above Louis lies
dead, and Morgan and Maxwell stand in terror, listening to the sounds of the
struggle below. What does it portend—what, except that they are in deadly peril?
They are too terrified to move. If they open the door, they will be pounced upon
and arrested for the crime, for they do not doubt that the police have been
watching their movements, and have obtained entrance to the house. Suddenly the
sounds cease. Fordham lies senseless on the stairs, and Jack is speeding to the
railway station. All is quiet without and within, for the partners in crime are
too frightened to move. At length they venture to speak, but in a whisper, for
they still fear that officers are lurking outside to secure them. After a long
interval of time they pluck up sufficient courage to open the door. No one
molests them. They creep out into the passage, and down the stairs, and are
stopped by the body of Fordham. Maxwell recognizes him, and a devilish plot
suggests itself. John Fordham and Louis are old enemies—how easy to fasten the
murder upon John! He and Morgan carry the body of the unconscious man into the
room, and place it near the dead body of Louis. They find a knife upon him—they
dip it in Louis&#39; blood. Maxwell takes Fordham&#39;s watch, and finds his matchbox on
the stairs. He has an idea that they may come in useful to fix the murder upon
Fordham. He leaves the knife. Then he and Morgan steal from the house.</p>

<p>Thus far did I trace the probable course of action. If it were anywhere near
the truth, it established a binding link between Maxwell and Morgan, each of
whom, from that night, held the other in his power. I asked myself whether
Maxwell confided to Morgan the existence of the family connection which existed
between him and John Fordham. To this question I found an answer. No. It was not
in Maxwell&#39;s nature to impart to any one a confidence which might result to his
disadvantage. Without having met the man, I seemed to see him, so graphically
was he portrayed by Fordham and Jack. He was one who kept his own secrets.</p>

<p>What followed on their departure is related by Fordham up to the moment of
his own departure, when he fled from the house, leaving the dead body of Louis
as its only occupant. Possibly he was watched and seen by his enemies, who
re-entered the house after he was gone. They feel in Louis&#39; pocket for his
watch. &quot;He has stolen it,&quot; they say. They look round for Louis&#39; overcoat. &quot;He
has run off with it,&quot; they say. And then their eyes fall upon Fordham&#39;s
blood-stained knife, which he foolishly left behind him. I can imagine their
fiendish glee at these discoveries. &quot;He has convicted himself,&quot; they say. But
there is still a possible danger. Louis might have been seen in their company.
If his features were mutilated so that it would be difficult to establish his
identity, it would afford them an additional element of safety. The heavy oak
table is dashed upon his face, and their work is complete. Once more the house
of death is left in possession of its ghastly occupant.</p>

<p>While I was following out these conjectures (for of course they were nothing
more, and it will be seen in time whether they were correct) I received a report
from the Liverpool expert to whom I had entrusted the two letters. It confirmed
my suspicions, and furnished me with another link to the chain I was weaving.
Although an attempt had been made to disguise the writing of the letter sent by
&quot;Mr. Lambert&quot; to the house agent, the expert stated that both letters were
written by the same hand. Scoundrel as Maxwell was, he would have been more
careful had he imagined that the plot to fleece Louis would have ended so
tragically.</p>

<p>Now, of what legal value was all this evidence? A skillful lawyer might do
something with it, but I doubted whether, unsupported and uncorroborated, it
would establish John Fordham&#39;s innocence. In this view Fordham himself
concurred; indeed, it was he who first laid emphasis upon it. I have seldom seen
a man more agitated when he learned from me that there was no guilt of blood
upon his soul. For several minutes he could not speak. He sat with his face
buried in his hands, and when he raised his head the tears were still running
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>&quot;I can bear the worst now,&quot; he said; and I knew from the remarks he made,
that he was more grateful for Ellen&#39;s sake than for his own. I shall call her
Ellen; surely I have the right, working as I was for her and for the man who
had, in a sort of way, supplanted me. Had she seen me first—but of what use is
it to speculate upon what might have been?</p>

<p>As I have said, it was Fordham who laid stress upon the evidence against
himself, evidence of his own supplying. His silence, his long concealment in
London under an assumed name, the incriminating articles in his possession,
which he had given up to the police, were strong points against him.</p>

<p>&quot;If my innocence is not clearly proved,&quot; he said, &quot;I shall not care to be
released.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t compel a jury to declare you guilty,&quot; I urged, and I confess to
being angry with him.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;but the doubt would remain and would darken my days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;anyway, the police are not likely to let you go without a
searching inquiry. For the present we must be silent, and bend all our energies
to the discovery of Maxwell and Morgan.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a hard matter to convince Ellen of the wisdom of this course, and
indeed we did not succeed in convincing her; but she was compelled to yield in
the end, though she protested against the injustice of Fordham being kept in
prison. There is a reason of the heart and a reason of the head, and when we are
dealing with stern facts, we know which is likely to come out the winner.</p>

<p>The position, you see, was one of great difficulty. I was pledged to Jack,
and to break my word would be to bring him immediately into danger. This I
determined not do until every other chance failed me. It was a prudent as well
as a just resolve. If Jack found himself betrayed and brought to bay, it was as
likely as not that he would deny everything, or that he would commit himself to
statements which would place Fordham in jeopardy.</p>

<p>I met my card-sharping friend before the end of the week, when it had been
decided that he was to pay me a visit. I was on my way to Highgate Cemetery, and
I came across him in the N. W. district. He had hired a donkey, and there was a
gay show of flowers on his barrow. Seeing me approach, he gave me a wink and an
almost imperceptible shake of the head. I inferred from the wink that business
was prospering, and from the nod that he did not wish to be spoken to. I
returned his wink and passed on.</p>

<p>My object in going to Highgate Cemetery was to ascertain if a lady of the
name of Fordham was buried there, as would certainly have been the case if, as
had been stated by Maxwell, Louis&#39; mother was dead. As I have already said, I
did not believe he had spoken the truth, but if I was mistaken I should be able
to learn the address from which the coffin was taken.</p>

<p>I was not mistaken. There was a family grave in the cemetery purchased by
John Fordham&#39;s father, but since his death no one had been buried there.
Undoubtedly Maxwell had lied, and Louis&#39; mother was alive.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession31" href="#ch31">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<h3>PAUL GODFREY, DETECTIVE, CONTINUES HIS NARRATIVE.</h3>


<p class="p2">The motive—the motive. This was the subject of my thoughts as I
walked from the Cemetery. What possible motive could Maxwell have in making John
Fordham believe that his stepmother was dead? If she were living, Fordham could
have nothing to hope from her; if she were dead, it was an obstacle removed from
his path, a witness the less against him. It was not likely that Maxwell was
anxious to afford him this satisfaction; there was a cunning motive for the
deceit, but though I twisted the question a dozen different ways, I could not
make head or tail of it.</p>

<p>Puzzling my head over the matter, I found myself in the neighborhood of Soho.</p>

<p>It was not chance that directed me there. I had not forgotten the woman,
Annette Lourbet, who plays so important a part in John Fordham&#39;s confession, and
though she seemed to have passed out of the story at about the time he left
England for Australia, I had an idea, if I succeeded in discovering her, that I
might obtain some useful information. I hardly knew in what shape, but in such a
task as mine the slightest clue frequently leads to a momentous result.</p>

<p>Up to this day my search for. Annette had been unsuccessful. Of course, I had
looked through the London Directory for the name of Lourbet, but curiously
enough, it did not appear there, and I concluded either that the woman had
married or had returned to her native country. If she had married and was still
in London, Soho was the most likely neighborhood in which to find her, and I had
already spent several fruitless hours in those narrow thoroughfares. My
patience, however, was not exhausted, and I was now treading them again in the
hope of a better reward.</p>

<p>I think I may say that hitherto chance had not befriended me, but on this day
it did me a turn, and in a singular way. About to pass a continental provision
shop, of which there are a great many in Soho, and in the windows of which was
the usual display of German sausages, pickles, potted meats, French mustard,
pretzels, Dutch herrings, cucumbers, etc., I was obstructed by a ladder, and had
to cross the road. A sign-painter was at work on the ladder, and glancing at the
board over the window, I saw that a name had been erased and was being replaced
by another, the first letter, L, having just been painted in bright blue. I
walked on, attaching no importance to the incident; but when, half an hour
afterwards, I passed the shop again, and saw that the painter had got as far as
L O U, something like an electric shock darted through me.</p>

<p>L O U, the first three letters in the name of Lourbet.</p>

<p>I did not linger; the next minute I was in an adjoining street. The shop
would not run away, and the proprietor would not run away. I could afford to
wait.</p>

<p>I did wait for an hour and more before I sauntered again through that
particular street. The sign was finished, and stared me in the face. I could
have hugged myself when I saw the full name of Lourbet on the signboard.</p>

<p>Now, was the name that of a woman, and was her Christian name Annette? Half a
dozen persons were looking up at it in admiration of the painter&#39;s skill. One,
however, a little man who appeared to have been drinking was regarding it with
wrath and dissatisfaction; he even went so far as to shake his fist at it. He
was a most disreputable looking character, and evidently a confirmed toper. As
he held up his fist a woman darted from the shop, and standing at the door fired
one word at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Pig!&quot;</p>

<p>In response to which he directed his fist towards her face. This so inflamed
her that she flew at him, and, seizing him by the collar, shook him with such
violence that he fell to the ground the moment he was released. By this time a
crowd had gathered, whose sympathies were entirely on her side. They jeered and
laughed at the man, with whom they appeared to be acquainted, and who lay in a
state of collapse. Not that he was hurt, except, as a matter of course, in his
feelings, but he was afraid to rise and risk a second shaking at the hands of
the woman, who seemed to be smarting under a sense of injury. To my surprise she
became suddenly quite calm and composed, and stood looking down upon him with a
disdainful smile on her thin, white lips.</p>

<p>&quot;It is well done, Madame Lourbet,&quot; cried a Frenchwoman in the crowd. &quot;It is
as he deserves. I would wring his neck if he had served me so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, madame,&quot; replied Madame Lourbet, &quot;for the name. It is my own.
Behold it, pig!&quot; Addressing her discomfited foe, and pointing to the
newly-painted sign. &quot;I r-r-renounce you. Come to me no more. Begone!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a melodramatic touch in her words, but not in her utterance of
them. Had I not witnessed it I could hardly have believed that they were spoken
by the woman who had behaved with so much violence. The cold, passionless voice
was, in my judgment, the result of long training, and I detected in her so many
little resemblances to the Annette portrayed by John Fordham in his confession
that I did not doubt I had found her at last. I was careful to keep out of her
sight, having determined to seek enlightenment first from the man, for I was
curious to learn the meaning of this singular scene.</p>

<p>The approach of a policeman put an end to it. The crowd dissolved, Madame
Lourbet returned to her shop, and the man, whose furtive looks had followed her
movements, slowly picked himself up. If he had been inclined to appeal against
the judgment which had been pronounced he was manifestly not in a condition to
do so just now; seemingly recognizing this, he slunk off with the air of a
whipped cur.</p>

<p>The policeman took no notice of him, and was soon out of sight; I kept in his
track till he halted at the door of a public-house and fumbled in his pockets.
Finding nothing there he relapsed into a state of maudlin despair. This was my
opportunity, and I took advantage of it. Over a friendly glass or two, he
drinking my share and his own with cheerful alacrity, he ventilated his
grievances.</p>

<p>Annette was his wife, so ne declared; they had lived together three years;
she had worshiped the ground he trod on, and his name had been painted over the
shop window. And now, after he had ruined himself for her (he did not specify in
what way) she turned upon him and cast him adrift. He would not stand it—no, he
was an Englishman, and he would not stand it. She was tired of him, was she? She
had another lover, had she? He would have his blood. And so on, and so on.</p>

<p>The real fact was that there had been a trifling informality in the marriage,
the man I was pumping being married already when he went through the ceremony
with Annette. It was true that his first wife died shortly after he married his
second, but Annette had only lately discovered that her own marriage was
illegal, and being tired of the rascal was glad to be quit of him. She had been
prudent enough to protect her savings; the business was hers, the stock was
hers, and she had turned him out with never a penny in his pockets.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a penny, not one single penny,&quot; he whined. I sympathized with him, of
course, and I left him at his lodgings—a garret in the same street as the
shop—with a promise to call upon him the next night and see if anything could be
done to soften Annette&#39;s heart.</p>

<p>The information I had extracted from him was not of much present use to me,
but I saw the possibility of the acquaintanceship being of service, and I was by
no means dissatisfied with my day&#39;s work; but the day was not yet over. I have
good reason to remember it, and so has every person associated with the mystery,
so many strange things occurred—the strangest of all (which at first seemed to
have not the slightest connection with the affair) leading to a most surprising
and unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>It was my intention to pay Madame Lourbet a visit, and I thought that evening
would be the best time. I had business to transact at my office, for this
Liverpool murder, though it occupied so much of my time, was not the only thing
I had to attend to. So to my office I went and spent a useful hour in
straightening my affairs and giving instructions to my clerk. Then I sat down to
catch up arrears of correspondence, and by four o&#39;clock I had everything in
order. I had put away my papers and stamped the last of my letters when my clerk
announced a lady—Mrs. Barlow, who was most anxious to see me. She was shown in,
an elderly lady, with a careworn face and ladylike manners. She had been
recommended to me, as a likely person to discover her son, whom she had not seen
for five or six years.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor heard from him?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a line,&quot; she answered in a sad voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he in England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, tell me all about it,&quot; I said, &quot;and bear in mind that your time and
money will be thrown away if you keep anything in the background.&quot;</p>

<p>I condense what she related. She was a widow, with one child, this son who
had deserted her. He had always given her trouble. Not that he was bad at heart,
but so easily led away, believing in everybody, trusting everybody. (Mother&#39;s
love, here; I knew its value in a practical sense.) Unfortunately he had fallen
into bad company, and her belief was that he was ashamed to return to her. Years
ago they had been fairly well off, but little by little he had got from her all
she was worth, and then he left her. She managed to rub along, however, being
assisted by Philip&#39;s uncle, her deceased husband&#39;s brother. This uncle had
lately died and left her a small legacy, which she had received. A legacy of
three thousand pounds was left to Philip; in case of his death at the time of
the testator&#39;s decease the money would go to a charitable institution. Philip
had not presented himself to claim the legacy, and she was naturally anxious to
discover him, so she had come to me to assist her.</p>

<p>A simple story, before the end of which I had made up my mind about the man.
A thoroughly bad lot—an opinion I kept to myself, however.</p>

<p>I put a few questions to Mrs. Barlow.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you think of any reason why your son should not come forward to claim
this fortune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>She was afraid to express what must have been in her mind—that he was dead.</p>

<p>&quot;He fell into bad company, you say. What kind of bad company? I must press
for an answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately he was fond of cards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blacklegs got hold of him, then?&quot; She sighed. &quot;Did he bet on horses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That explains a great deal. He went to races and lost his money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everybody took advantage of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Now, Mrs. Barlow, if I take this matter up I must have a free hand.
Among other things I shall do I may have to advertise. If you have any
objection, you had best say so at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may do anything you like—only discover my son for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well. Have you a portrait of your son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes—a cabinet in a frame. I did not bring it with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Send it immediately to my private address. I should like it soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have it to-night. I will bring it myself.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave her my private card, and took five pounds from her for preliminary
expenses.</p>

<p>She was about to leave, when she turned and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I ought to tell you that a friend mentioned that he thought he saw
Philip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly you ought to tell me. The mischief of these cases is that there is
always something kept back. Where did he see him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In Liverpool, but he is not certain it was Philip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very stupid of him. How long ago was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over a year ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that is all,&quot; she said, and bade me good-day.</p>

<p>Before I left my office I wrote an advertisement for the personal columns of
the daily papers, to the effect that if Philip Barlow called upon or
communicated with me, he would hear of something very much to his advantage.
Instructing my clerk to insert the advertisement in three of the principal
newspapers, I went to my lodgings and made a change in my appearance, which I
deemed prudent, in view of my visit to Madame Lourbet.</p>

<p>That lady was not in her shop when I entered it. In response to a rap on the
counter, she issued from an inner room, and asked what I required. There was a
glass panel in the door of this room, across which a green curtain was drawn. I
have a faculty of observation which enables me to see a great deal at a glance.</p>

<p>While I was making a few small purchases, I entered &#39;into conversation with
her. I said that I had been recommended to her shop, but had some difficulty in
finding it, in consequence of the name over the window being altered. She
admitted the alteration, and said that the business would in future be conducted
under the new name.</p>

<p>&quot;Your own name, I presume, madame?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;My own name,&quot; she answered. &quot;It makes no difference in what I sell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None at all,&quot; I said, briskly. &quot;You were spoken of, I remember, as Madame
Annette.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That, also, is my name. May I ask, monsieur, by whom you were recommended?&quot;</p>

<p>I watched her face keenly as I replied, &quot;Madame, or rather, Mrs. Fordham.&quot;</p>

<p>As I uttered the name I observed a slight disturbance of the green curtain.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, monsieur,&quot; she said, and went into the private room, the door of
which she carefully opened and shut.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; thought I, &quot;what is the meaning of this, and will it make any
difference in Madame Lourbet&#39;s behavior?&quot;</p>

<p>It made a perceptible difference. Something had passed between her and the
person in the inner room which had put her on her guard, and she was watching me
now as keenly as I was watching her.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame Fordham,&quot; she remarked, with assumed indifference, continuing our
conversation. &quot;Who is Madame Fordham?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I supposed she was a customer of yours,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;It may be,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, yes, it may be; but does one know all one&#39;s
customers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be difficult,&quot; I said, laughing, &quot;with such a connection as you
have, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right, monsieur, it would be difficult. Do you require anything
more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing more, thank you, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>She let an arrow fly. &quot;I will send the articles home and the bill, if
monsieur will kindly give me his address.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much obliged, madame,&quot; was my reply: &quot;I will pay for them, and take them
with me.&quot;</p>

<p>So the little passage at arms ended, and I walked away just a trifle wiser
than I came, for I had learned that Madame Lourbet did not desire to talk about
John Fordham&#39;s stepmother, and that there was some person behind the green
curtain who also had an interest in the matter. Had I deemed it safe I would
have kept watch for that person outside Madame Lourbet&#39;s shop, but I felt that I
was dealing with a woman as clever as myself, and I recognized the necessity of
caution. It was annoying, but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>The day had been one of the busiest in my recollection, and I was glad to sit
down to a cup of tea in my own private apartment. During the meal I was debating
how the incidents I have recorded could be turned to advantage, when the
landlady came in and informed me that a man was down-stairs who insisted on
seeing me. She did not like to let him up, she said, he was such a
common-looking man; besides, he was the worse for liquor. But he would not go
away.</p>

<p>&quot;I did all I could, sir,&quot; said my landlady, &quot;but go he wouldn&#39;t. &#39;Tell him
it&#39;s Jack,&#39; he said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jack!&quot; I cried, interrupting her. &quot;Show him in at once, and don&#39;t let us be
interrupted; I have business with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Much astonished, she departed on her errand, and the next minute Jack stood
before me.</p>

<p>My first impression was that the landlady was right, and that Jack had been
drinking. His face was as white as a sheet, his eyes glared, and his limbs shook
like a man in a palsy.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re a pretty object,&quot; I said, sternly; but he did not seem to hear what I
said.</p>

<p>&quot;Guv&#39;nor,&quot; he gasped, in a horse voice, &quot;is that tea? Will yer give me a cup?
My throat&#39;s on fire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well it might be,&quot; I answered, filling a cup, &quot;but I should have thought
brandy was more in your way. You&#39;ll come to a bad end, my lad.&quot;</p>

<p>Still he did not seem to understand me, but took the cup with his shaking
hands, holding it in both lest it should slip to the ground. As it was he
spilled half of it before it reached his mouth. I took the cup from him, and
placing it on the table said:</p>

<p>&quot;Now, what is the meaning of this? How dare you come here in such a state?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me time, guv&#39;nor, give me time,&quot; he croaked. &quot;I shall be better in a
minute. Yer think I&#39;ve been drinkin&#39;. Yer wos never more mistook. I &#39;ad a pint
o&#39; mild this mornin&#39;, but I &#39;ope I may drop down dead if another drop &#39;as passed
my lips the &#39;ole of this blessed day. I&#39;ve &#39;ad a scare, guv&#39;nor—I&#39;ve &#39;ad a
scare.&quot; He dropped his voice, and bending forward, said: &quot;Did yer ever see a
ghost?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of, Jack. You look as if you&#39;d seen one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I &#39;ave, guv&#39;nor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said I, becoming interested, in spite of my suspicion that he was
drunk, his manner was so earnest, &quot;whose ghost?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ghost of &#39;im as wos murdered. The ghost of Louis Fordham.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are dreaming, Jack,&quot; I said, staring at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Not me, guv&#39;nor. I&#39;m wide awake, I am. Oh!&quot; He gave a sudden start, and
turned his head over his shoulder, as though a spirit was standing behind him.</p>

<p>&quot;You see one now, perhaps,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;No, guv&#39;nor, but I don&#39;t know as &#39;e mightn&#39;t appear in this wery room. Is
there such things, or am I goin&#39; mad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not unlikely, Jack, when you come to me with such a cock and bull story. I
recollect your saying that you&#39;d seen the murdered man lying on a green field
and on a billiard table. This is something of the same sort, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, guv&#39;nor, that was a wision, and I knew it wosn&#39;t real. But this wos. I
touched it as it passed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it passed you, did it? Come, my man, let us have the whole of it; I may
understand it better then. Where were you, what time of day was it, and in what
shape did it appear to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The shape wos &#39;is own, and the time o&#39; day was four this arternoon, and the
place wos Finchley Road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go on, Jack,&quot; I said, seeing that he believed in it.</p>

<p>&quot;I was out with the barrer,&quot; he continued, &quot;and was bargainin&#39; with a lady
for some daisies. There they wos on the pavement, and she and me lookin&#39; at &#39;em.
As I stooped to pick up a pot, somethink brushed by me. We touched each other.
Lookin&#39; up I sor Louis, and the pot dropped from my hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you go after him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me go arter &#39;im. I&#39;d &#39;ave run a &#39;undered miles the other way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he vanish in blue flames, Jack?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, guv&#39;nor. &#39;E turned a corner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, consider, my lad. The man is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t I know it?&quot; cried Jack, as if my remark exasperated him. &quot;Is it likely
I should &#39;ave come to you if &#39;e&#39;d been alive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You looked up at him, you say. Did he look down at you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, guv&#39;nor, not that I noticed. D&#39;yer think I&#39;ve been makin&#39; up the story?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don&#39;t think that, because there&#39;s nothing to gain by it. What I do
think is that you&#39;ve been scared by seeing some one who bears a resemblance to
Louis. It isn&#39;t at all an uncommon thing. Innocent men have been hanged upon
such evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guv&#39;nor,&quot; said Jack, impressively, &quot;it wos &#39;im, I tell yer. There wos &#39;is
&#39;eight, there was &#39;is build, and there wos the scar on &#39;is fore&#39;ead. I&#39;ll take
my Bible oath it wos Louis&#39; ghost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even the scar may be on the other man&#39;s forehead,&quot; I persisted. &quot;There have
been much closer resemblances. A dozen witnesses have sworn to the identity of a
man who was being tried for a crime of which he was as innocent as I am, have
sworn to his voice, to the color of his eyes and hair, to secret marks upon his
person, to a missing tooth, to the peculiar shape of his fingers, and he has
been condemned upon their evidence. Only after his death has it been discovered
that the wrong man had been hanged. Wives themselves have been taken in, and
have lived for years with men they believed to be their husbands. Go home, Jack,
and think of these cases, much more wonderful than your accidental resemblance,
and don&#39;t make a fool of yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>I might as well have spoken to a stone. Jack was not to be argued out of his
fright, and that it was genuine was proved by the startled looks he cast behind
him from time to time. A gentle tap at the door sent his heart into his mouth.
It was my landlady, who came with a parcel that had been left for me by a lady,
who wished to hand it to me herself, but was told I was engaged and could not be
disturbed. As I had exhausted all my arguments upon Jack, and as he did not seem
in a hurry to go, I opened the parcel in his presence, and drew out the cabinet
portrait of Mrs. Barlow&#39;s missing son which she had promised to bring to my
lodgings.</p>

<p>&quot;Send I may live, guv&#39;nor!&quot; cried Jack, peering at it over my shoulder, his
eyes almost starting out of his head, &quot;where did you get that from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the picture of a missing man, Jack,&quot; I replied, &quot;who has had a lump of
money left to him. I want to lay my hands on him.&quot; It was then that I noticed
the strange expression on Jack&#39;s face, and I added, jokingly, &quot;It isn&#39;t a
ghost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it ain&#39;t a ghost,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s Morgan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Morgan!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Your card-sharping Liverpool friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s &#39;im, guv&#39;nor. A lump o&#39; money left &#39;im! Why don&#39;t &#39;e come and collar
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure you are not mistaken?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Ow could I be mistook?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Wosn&#39;t &#39;im and me together day and
night for weeks and weeks? I&#39;d swear to &#39;im among a &#39;undered.&quot;</p>

<p>Reluctant as I was to take Jack&#39;s word for Louis&#39; ghost, I could not dispute
with him as to Morgan&#39;s portrait. It was long before I could get rid of him, and
he went away as firmly convinced of one as he was of the other. In such positive
terms did he express his conviction on the former subject that if I were not a
hard-headed, practical man, with very little sentiment in my nature, it is quite
on the cards that he would have shaken my belief that he was laboring under some
monstrous delusion in respect of the murdered man. At the same time I confess to
being curious about Louis&#39; &quot;double,&quot; and to having a desire to see him with my
own eyes. It was for this reason, on the chance of being gratified, that I made
an appointment to accompany Jack the next day in his peregrinations through the
N. W. district, in the disguise of a brother coster. The hour of appointment was
noon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was much to think of, much to do. Fortunately I am a healthy
man and can do with three or four hours&#39; sleep, or I should never have got
through with it.</p>

<p>There was in my mind the design, not yet thoroughly planned out, of having
Louis&#39; body exhumed, in order that its identity might be established beyond the
possibility of doubt. This would effectually dispose of Jack&#39;s fancies, which,
after further reflection, I set down to the stings of conscience, and as
properly belonging to that form of imaginative creation which had conjured up
the vision of Louis&#39; body lying on a billiard cloth and on green fields. To
establish this identity witnesses would be required. I could give evidence as to
the scar upon the forehead, but only from what I had been told; it would be
secondary evidence, and therefore not admissible. I mentally ran through the
names of the witnesses whose evidence, from personal knowledge, would be of
value.</p>

<p>John Fordham, for one. Though it might tell against himself, he would be
ready and willing to testify. I needed nothing to convince me that he was a
truthful and honorable man who would not palter with his conscience even though
it added to the peril in which he stood.</p>

<p>Then, Jack. But it would bring him into danger. A far different character he
from Fordham. He would be dragged forward against his will, and in these
circumstances his word could not be depended upon. In the present aspect of the
affair his was the only evidence upon which Fordham&#39;s innocence could be to some
extent proved. Believing himself to be in danger such a man as Jack would be
capable of anything; he might deny all that he had admitted, he might even
concoct a story which would throw the entire guilt upon the man I was trying to
save. Therefore, Jack&#39;s evidence upon this question of identity could not be
reckoned with just now. For a time at least it must be set aside.</p>

<p>Then, Louis&#39; mother. But her son&#39;s name had appeared in the papers as that of
the man whom, by Fordham&#39;s confession, he had murdered. It must not be forgotten
that I was convinced she was living. That being so, why was she silent? Why did
she remain in hiding? That was one of the unanswered questions in the Mystery.</p>

<p>Then, Maxwell. Also in hiding. He, of all who were associated in the mystery,
was the least likely to come forward of his own free will. Then, Morgan——</p>

<p>At his name my reflections were diverted into another channel. Three thousand
pounds was a handsome sum—a Godsend to such a man. Why had he not claimed it?
There was more than one answer to the question. He might not be aware of his
uncle&#39;s death; as his own mother did not know his address the solicitors to the
will could not communicate with him. He might be dead; he might have left the
country. If he were living would my advertisement in the personal columns of the
newspapers be successful in unearthing him? It occurred to me that it would
increase my chances of success if I advertised for him in his assumed name, and
I drew out the following advertisement:—</p>

<p>&quot;A Large Sum of Money has been Bequeathed to —— Morgan, who is supposed to
have been residing in Liverpool, where he was last seen about a year ago. Full
particulars will be given to him upon application to Paul Godfrey, 719
Buckingham Palace Road.&quot;</p>

<p>To reduce the chances of receiving letters from every Morgan in the kingdom,
I wrote to Mrs. Barlow, requesting her to give me the date of her son&#39;s birth,
his age, and whether he had any marks on his person by which he could be
identified. Though it is running ahead of my narrative, I may state here that
Mrs. Barlow supplied me with the date of her son&#39;s birth and his age (which
particulars I inserted in the advertisement), and informed me that there were
two marks on him which would render identification easy—a large mole on his left
side, a little above the hip, and a peculiar formation in the toe next to the
big toe on his right foot. It was bent completely under, she said, and presented
the appearance of having been cut clean off at the joint.</p>

<p>I went out at eleven o&#39;clock that night to post my letters to Mrs. Barlow,
and was returning home, deep in thought, when a hand was laid on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Godfrey.&quot;</p>

<p>The voice was Wheeler&#39;s, like myself a private detective, with whom I had
worked on two or three cases. There was a talk of our going into partnership,
but it had not yet come to a head. There are few smarter men than Wheeler.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening,&quot; I said, and immediately began to consider whether he could be
of use to me. &quot;Anything stirring?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he answered, &quot;I was coming to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of giving me a direct answer, he began to laugh, and said, &quot;You were
in Soho this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hallo,&quot; said I, interested immediately, &quot;there&#39;s something in the wind. Did
you see me there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but I saw you coming into Leicester Square.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you find me out?&quot; I asked, rather nettled. &quot;I thought my disguise a
good one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it was. There isn&#39;t one in a thousand who would have recognized you. I
happen to be that one. You see, Godfrey, when you are thinking of something very
particular, you have a nasty habit of stroking your chin with the middle finger
of your right hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; said I, &quot;you will never catch me doing that again when I&#39;m somebody
else. Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing that, I took special notice of you, and followed you home to make
sure. When you stopped at 719 Buckingham Palace Road, and let yourself in, I was
satisfied it was you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing very smart in that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t say there is. I kept myself out of sight, for a reason you&#39;ll
appreciate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t the only one who was following you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say I was being shadowed?&quot; I cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;That is exactly what I do mean. &#39;I&#39;ll see this out,&#39; said I to myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Man or woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you catch sight of his face?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Tall, dark, beard and whiskers. Might have been false. When you were in
the house he passed the door, looked at the number and walked away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you let him go?&quot; I said reproachfully. &quot;I didn&#39;t think that of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You needn&#39;t. I followed him on your account.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bravo!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had to be very careful. His eyes were in all directions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he go back to Soho?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He took a &#39;bus to Piccadilly Circus. I took the same &#39;bus. He got down
there, with a lot of others, and I slipped out among them. Then he took an Atlas
&#39;bus to the Eyre Arms. So did I. He walked towards the Swiss Cottage, and my
difficulties commenced. Not much foot traffic between the Eyre Arms and the
Swiss Cottage, you know. He went on to Fitzjohn&#39;s Parade. More traffic there.
The job got easier. Beyond Fitzjohn&#39;s Parade, very little traffic indeed. I had
to be more careful than ever, so few people about. That was the end of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know the house he went into?&quot; I cried.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; he answered. &quot;I am ashamed to say he gave me the slip. I don&#39;t
know whether he suspected he was being followed, but the fact remains that he
gave me the slip. How he managed it beats me. I am fairly ashamed of myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ought to be. Wheeler, you were on the track of a great mystery," and just
at the very point—— I was so annoyed that I couldn&#39;t finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;I remained in the neighborhood a couple of hours,&quot; he continued, &quot;but saw
nothing more of the gentleman. If I had suspected there was anything important
hanging to it he would have had to be a great deal smarter than he is to throw
me off the track. However, it&#39;s no use crying over spilt milk. I&#39;ve nothing to
do this week. Can I be of any help to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; I replied. &quot;Come and see me at eight o&#39;clock in the morning,
and I&#39;ll tell you all about it. I must have time to think this out. Though you
were not entirely successful you have done me a great service, and I am obliged
to you. Oh, Wheeler, if you had only seen the house he went into!&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head mournfully, and left me, promising to call in the morning.</p>

<p>I had, indeed, plenty to think about. It was in Finchley Road that Jack
fancied he saw the ghost of Louis. This man, following me from Madame Lourbet&#39;s
shop, where he had been hidden from my gaze by a green curtain, had made his way
to Finchley, where, presumably, he lived. I might now almost call the case upon
which I was engaged The Mystery of the Green Curtain.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession32" href="#ch32">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Punctually at eight o&#39;clock the following morning Wheeler
presented himself, and under the seal of secrecy I gave him a fair insight into
the Mystery. He was greatly excited, and said if I succeeded in bringing the
truth to light I was a made man. I was beginning to think so myself, but I did
not underrate the difficulties with which I had to contend. I seemed to be
pulled in so many ways at once, and to have so many things to look after, that I
saw the danger of wasting my time upon matters of no importance and allowing the
leading strings to slip away from me. I was glad, therefore, to obtain the
services of a man upon whom I could rely, and as I deemed it imperatively
necessary that I should remain in London, I explained to Wheeler my desire that
Louis&#39; body should be exhumed and identified, and asked him if he thought he
could manage it. He was confident he could; he had friends among the Liverpool
police who would do all in their power for him; he laughed at the suggestion of
the difficulties that might present themselves, and declared he would carry out
his mission even if he had to dig up the body himself in the dead of night.
Knowing Wheeler to be a bit of a bulldog, and daring as well as tenacious, I was
more than satisfied with his assurances.</p>

<p>&quot;You will have a surgeon with you,&quot; I said, &quot;whose evidence will be
conclusive as to the scar on the forehead. I understand the bone was penetrated.
Everything must be done quickly, and above all the affair must be kept out of
the newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p>I laid special emphasis upon this, because I did not intend that the game
should be taken out of my hands. We settled upon an address in Liverpool to
which I could write or wire any further instructions that might be necessary,
and he went off in high spirits to catch the ten o&#39;clock train.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to my office I paid a visit to my dram-drinking friend who
had been cast off by Madame Lourbet. His name, which she had renounced, was
Whybrow. I passed her shop on the way, having no fear that I would be
recognized, and taking particular care not to rub my chin with the middle finger
of my right hand. I saw Madame Lourbet behind the counter, and caught a glimpse
of that confounded green curtain. It is curious how one thing suggests another.
The moment my eyes fell upon the curtain an idea suggested itself which set me
laughing, and which proved to be perhaps the most important step in the
elucidation of the Mystery. I will not mention it in this place, but I
determined to act upon it later on if I considered it advisable. Clever as
Madame Lourbet was I hoped to show that I was one too many for her.</p>

<p>Mr. Whybrow was in bed, pining for liquor. I sent out for a quartern of
gin—that being the cheapest tipple—and under its influence, and fortified by my
saying that I thought I should be able to bring Madame Lourbet to book in his
interests, he became communicative. I learned that she had two friends who
visited her from time to time, and with whom he was not allowed to strike up an
acquaintance. One of these was a man, the other a woman. I paid close attention
to his description of the man, whom he suspected had supplanted him in her
affections. This man was tall and dark; but he had no beard or whiskers. I
thought of Wheeler&#39;s words, &quot;they might have been false,&quot; and I left Mr. Whybrow
with the conviction that it was the man who had followed me from Soho. If that
were so I had alarmed him by my reference to Louis&#39; mother, and he had signaled
to Madame Lourbet to give her a warning that I might be a spy; his beard and
whiskers being false was another point in my favor. I had sufficient confidence
to introduce myself in my own proper person to that lady and make a trifling
purchase. She served me politely, but there was trouble in her face, which
rather pleased me than otherwise. I was pleased, too, that she betrayed no
recognition of me, and did not connect me with the man who had paid her a visit
the night before.</p>

<p>Leaving her, I went on to John Fordham, who was still under remand, and
likely to remain so for some time yet, for the police had not progressed in
their inquiries, and Fordham had made no recantation of the accusation he had
brought against himself. Cheering him with the news that I was gathering
valuable information (of which I did not give him the particulars) I obtained
from him a description of Maxwell&#39;s personal appearance. Tall and dark, wearing
neither beard nor whiskers. That settled it. Maxwell was the man who was
stationed behind the green curtain, who had shadowed me to my lodgings, and who
was so frightened by Fordham&#39;s public confession of the murder that, for his own
safety&#39;s sake, he went about now in a disguise. Good.</p>

<p>Then on to my office, where Mrs. Barlow was waiting to supply me with a
description of the birth marks of her missing son by which he could be
identified. These have already been recorded and need no further mention here.
Needless to say, I did not inform Mrs. Barlow that I had already obtained a clue
to the career of her son since she last saw or heard from him.</p>

<p>I made short work of the business in my office which required attention. So
absorbed was I in this mysterious Murder Mystery that I could not think
seriously of any other subject. My advertisement for Philip Barlow had thus
early unearthed three men of that name, whom I found in my office upon my
arrival there. I confronted them with Mrs. Barlow, and they were immediately
dismissed, much to their dissatisfaction. My second advertisement inquiring for
Morgan, was dispatched to the newspaper offices, and I left with my clerk a
memorandum of the age and birthday of Mrs. Barlow&#39;s son, which were to be the
first questions put to all applicants of either name who presented themselves.
Their answers not tallying with my memorandum, they were to be sent to the
right-about. By these means a great deal of unnecessary trouble was avoided.</p>

<p>At a quarter to twelve I sallied forth to keep my appointment with Jack,
having first effected the requisite alteration in my appearance. My own clerk
was startled when I emerged from my private room in the character of a
costermonger, and was driven to say it was &quot;the best thing I had ever done in
the way of disguise.&quot; He was not far from the truth; I am always most successful
when I depict the manners of the lower class. Jack himself was taken in when I
slouched up to him and engaged him in conversation, and it was not till I spoke
in my proper voice that he recognized me.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m darned!&quot; was his admiring exclamation. &quot;Guv&#39;nor, you ought to go
on the stage.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a genuine compliment, and I felt that I had achieved something great.
If I don&#39;t make a fortune as a private inquiry agent I will go to the music
halls and sing coster songs.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Jack,&quot; said I, &quot;do you still believe in your ghost?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll take my oath on it,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>Then we went boldly forth, on the road to Finchley. First, however, in
pursuance of the idea which set me laughing earlier that morning when I passed
Madame Lourbet&#39;s shop, I turned the donkey&#39;s head in the direction of Soho,
which was not much out of our way. I had the temerity to enter her shop with a
couple of fine ferns, which I offered at so low a price that she was tempted to
purchase them, but not before she had baited me down twopence a pot. The price
she paid was eightpence. A shrewd woman at a bargain, this Madame Lourbet.</p>

<p>Laughing in my sleeve I rejoined Jack, and we pursued our journey in search
of Louis&#39; ghost. It did not appear, and though I kept a sharp lookout I saw
nothing of Maxwell. The only satisfaction I obtained was that the route taken by
Jack was the same by which Wheeler had tracked the tall, dark man who had been
concealed behind the green curtain in Madame Lourbet&#39;s shop. I returned home
late at night, and completely tired out. A costermonger&#39;s life is not an easy
one; he truly earns his livelihood by the sweat of his brow.</p>

<p>A telegram from Wheeler lay on my table: &quot;All goes well. The body will be
exhumed to-night.&quot; My opinion of him was justified; he was not the man to let
the grass grow under his feet. Nothing more could be done till I received his
report. On the following morning I received another telegram from him: &quot;Will be
with you at four this afternoon.&quot; Not a word as to the result of the
examination; but he certainly had lost no time.</p>

<p>So impatient was I as the hour approached that I could not keep indoors, but
walked up and down the street, to hail him the moment he appeared. A few minutes
past four o&#39;clock his cab rattled up to the door, and out he jumped.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a little behind time,&quot; he said as he paid the cabman, and I could see
that he was excited.</p>

<p>&quot;Those confounded trains—they are always late.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have news,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather queer news,&quot; he replied. &quot;Let us go in and talk.&quot;</p>

<p>He followed me to my room, the door of which he locked.</p>

<p>&quot;Give me a bite first,&quot; he said, &quot;and a drink; and then you shall hear
something startling.&quot;</p>

<p>I curbed my impatience while he ate and drank.</p>

<p>&quot;That has done me good,&quot; he said; &quot;I was almost famished. Before I commence,
Godfrey, I want to ask whether you deceived me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In what way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this. You told me that a man of the name of Louis Fordham was murdered,
and you described a certain mark by which his body could be identified.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The mark was a scar on his forehead, caused by a wound inflicted upon him by
a gardening tool. It penetrated to the bone, you said, and he would carry the
scar to his grave. If I misunderstood you, let me know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not misunderstand me. The scar is as I described. I have evidence
that it turned blood-red whenever he was excited. I have not misled you in the
slightest particular.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad to hear it. His half-brother, John Fordham, who gave himself up
for the murder——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of which we know him to be innocent,&quot; I interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;That is not the point I&#39;m coming to,&quot; said Wheeler. &quot;He gave himself up for
the murder, and he is positive that he left the dead body of Louis in the Rye
Street house when he left it on the morning of that terrific snow-storm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is quite positive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He recognized the body as that of Louis by the scar on the forehead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite correct.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then all I can say is that there is another mystery to be unraveled. Now,
for what I did. I went down to Liverpool, determined to see this matter through,
and not to waste a moment over it. I may fairly claim that not a moment has been
wasted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly. I could not have done it more expeditiously myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I &#39;pass over,&quot; he continued, &quot;the preliminary steps I took to effect my
object. The police assisted me, and an order from a magistrate armed me with the
necessary authority. Accompanied by two of the force and by a surgeon who knew
what he was about, the grave was dug up at eleven o&#39;clock last night, and the
coffin taken to the surgeon&#39;s house. There an examination of the body was made.
The upper portion of the skull was perfect. Neither during the man&#39;s lifetime,
nor after his death, had the slightest injury been inflicted on a single bone in
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible!&quot; I cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is the surgeon&#39;s report. It leads to but one conclusion. If such an
injury as you described to me was inflicted upon Louis Fordham, the body that
was buried is not his, but another man&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>I gazed at Wheeler, open-mouthed. Here was another mystery, indeed, if what
he stated was true.</p>

<p>&quot;You must have dug up the wrong grave,&quot; I said, when I recovered from my
astonishment.</p>

<p>&quot;It occurred to me that it might be so,&quot; he said, &quot;and I had it looked into.
No mistake has been made. The body the surgeon examined was that of the man who
had been murdered in Rye Street. Make up your mind to that, or you will be
thrown straight off the scent. The man we dug up was murdered; his face had been
smashed in, but as I have said, the upper part of the skull was uninjured. What
do you make of it?&quot;</p>

<p>What could I make of it except that both John Fordham and Jack were laboring
under some monstrous delusion? But to establish that hypothesis the conclusion
must be drawn that these two men were in collusion, and that an impossible story
had been invented for some hidden purpose. Now, except during the struggle on
the night of the murder, when Jack had dashed out of the house into the arms of
John Fordham, who was under the impression that a murderous attack was made upon
him, the men had never met, and each declared that he had not seen the face of
the other. How, then, could they have invented such a story? I dismissed the
idea as impossible. While I pondered over this fresh mystery, Wheeler sat
quietly looking at me and fingering the surgeon&#39;s report, which I had not taken
from him. Presently I found my voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Were there any other marks on the body by which it might be identified?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Wheeler replied, &quot;two. On the left side, just above the hip, is a
small growth of bone, which in lifetime might have been mistaken for a mole; and
the bones of the toe next to the big toe on the right foot are completely bent
under.&quot;</p>

<p>I listened in silent amazement. These were the marks upon the body of Philip
Barlow, alias Morgan. Here, then, was the key to the Mystery—here, to a certain
extent, was an explanation of the ghost of Louis that Jack saw in Finchley. For
if only one body was found in Rye Street, and only one body was buried (of which
there was proof positive), it was that of Maxwell&#39;s associate and confederate,
Morgan, and Louis Fordham must be alive. It was not Louis&#39; ghost that Jack saw,
it was Louis himself, and the reason why Philip Barlow had not come forward to
claim the legacy left to him by his uncle was satisfactorily explained. I
declare, my breath was almost taken away.</p>

<p>But how had this substitution of bodies been effected? Everything seemed to
hang upon an answer to this question. It must be answered, and answered soon,
and now without delay must I put into execution the idea that crossed my mind
when I caught sight of the green curtain on the morning of this very day. If any
person could assist me that person was Madame Lourbet.</p>

<p>In as few words as possible I explained to Wheeler the position of affairs
and my plan of action, in the carrying out of which his assistance was
necessary. He followed me with lively interest, and in a few minutes we were on
our way to Soho.</p>

<p>I entered the shop alone, Wheeler keeping watch in the street. I stood at the
counter while Madame Lourbet served a customer, and then she turned to me.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you require, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little information, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In private, madame,&quot; I said, &quot;unless you wish all the world to know.&quot;</p>

<p>She gathered from my tone that I had not come as a friend, and she was
instantly on her guard.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, monsieur, that I should not wish all the world to know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I advise that we speak in private,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;If I r-refuse, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will take the consequences, and we will converse before your customers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; she said, playing a devil&#39;s tattoo on the counter with her fingers, &quot;if
I mistake not, you were one of my customers this morning, monsieur. I had the
pleasure of serving you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had also the pleasure of serving you this morning, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So!&quot;</p>

<p>I assumed the voice of a costermonger, and inquired if she wished to buy any
more ferns. She caught her breath, and cried, &quot;It was you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was I, madame. It was also I, madame, who purchased of you last night and
gave you a reference.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A reference, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A reference, madame—to Mrs. Fordham, Louis&#39; mother, and stepmother to John
Fordham, now in prison for murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are clever, monsieur—very clever.&quot; I smiled. &quot;What is your John Fordham
to me? And what are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have the honor to be a detective. In that capacity behold me here.&quot; I
thought this rather dramatic and Frenchified, and I had the pleasure of seeing
her turn white to the lips. &quot;A comrade is on watch outside,&quot; I continued. She
slipped from the counter to the door, and peering cautiously about, saw Wheeler,
who, I being by her side, gave me a nod of recognition. &quot;Are you satisfied,
madame?&quot; I asked, when she had taken her place again behind the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;There is protection for women in this country,&quot; she said. &quot;Are you employed
by the Government?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fortunately for you I am not. You will, perhaps, understand when I say I am
a private detective. If a Government official were in my place it would be with
a warrant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A warrant, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A warrant, madame—for your arrest. Shall we converse here or in your private
room?&quot; She moved towards the green curtain. &quot;A moment,&quot; I said. &quot;Last night,
when I had the pleasure of purchasing some of your very excellent provisions,
and happened to mention that I was recommended by Mrs. Fordham, you had a
visitor in that room, who gave you a signal. Is the gentleman there now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no gentleman in the room,&quot; she said, throwing open the door. &quot;How
know you there was one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall surprise you, madame, with the extent of my knowledge. In order that
we may not be interrupted we will turn the key in the shop door.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not afraid?&quot; she asked, and there was a look in her eyes resembling
that of a cat who is about to spring.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, madame,&quot; I replied, following her to the inner room, &quot;the English
are not afraid of the French.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor the French of the English,&quot; she hissed.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a brave nation,&quot; I said, with a polite bow, &quot;so are we. I propose,
in your interests, an alliance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in your own, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in my own, madame. I am merely an agent, and am not in any danger. You
are a principal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A principal! What is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your knowledge of our language, Madame Lourbet, is almost perfect; one might
take you for a native, you speak English so fluently. But at your wish I will
explain what I mean by my use of the word. It is that of a man or a woman who,
without actually committing a crime, aids in its perpetration.</p>

<p>&quot;I defy you to prove that I knew of it,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;I have not finished—though your denial, being in the past tense (a point of
grammar, madame), is partial proof that it does not apply to the present. By the
term &#39;principal&#39; I mean also a man or a woman who, not being a witness of the
crime, assists afterwards in keeping those who are guilty out of the hands of
justice, and who, at the same time, assists in fixing that crime upon the
innocent. That affects you, madame, and if you persist in shielding the guilty,
you will see the inside of a prison door. I am going to be quite plain with you.
Some years ago you, being then in Paris, entered the service of a gentlemen who
is now in prison on a charge of murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not. I entered the service of a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;John Fordham&#39;s wife. In English law it is the same. You were John Fordham&#39;s
servant. You came to England with him and his wife and exercised authority in
his house. I am acquainted with every particular of your conduct during the
years you remained with them. You hated your master, and conspired against him.
Your mistress was a drunkard, and you secretly supplied her with liquor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She gave me orders, and I obeyed them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You went much further than that, madame. You invented lying stories against
your master, you gave secret evidence against him. I could entertain you for an
hour with the details of your treachery and that of other enemies of his with
whom you were in collusion. It succeeded too well. It drove him from his home,
it drove him from his country. Confess, madame, that I am well informed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I confess nothing. I wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not wait too long, madame. I pass over the intervening years, and come
straight to the peril in which you stand—a peril which, if you do not avert it
by your own action, your own immediate action, madame, will make a convict of
you. You know what that means, do you not? A convict—so many years&#39;
imprisonment—hard labor—no more red wine, no more nice French dishes. Somewhat
over a year ago a brutal murder was committed in Liverpool, and quite lately
your former master, Mr. John Fordham, laboring under a singular hallucination,
accuses himself of the murder of his half-brother Louis.&quot;</p>

<p>I kept my eyes on her face as I mentioned the name, but not a muscle moved.</p>

<p>&quot;It is his own business,&quot; she said, &quot;not mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall prove to you that it is yours in an indirect manner. You know of
this murder, you know that John Fordham is in prison on the charge of committing
it. It is my turn to wait now, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say that I know of it. What then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This. You are aware that Louis Fordham was not murdered, you are aware that
he is this day alive, and that John Fordham is innocent of the crime of which he
accused himself, and for which you would like to see him hanged. You are
intimately acquainted with Louis, you know where he lives. Last night, when I
was in your shop, a man was concealed behind this green curtain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was not Monsieur Louis,&quot; she cried, and then she bit her lip, as though
she had said too much.</p>

<p>&quot;No, madame,&quot; I said, smiling, &quot;it was not Monsieur Louis. The man was your
dead mistress&#39; brother, Maxwell. You see, madame, we have been keeping watch on
you. We have even the evidence of the rascal you married under a deplorable
misrepresentation. I refer to Monsieur Whybrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;The ingr-rate!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is a scoundrel, madame, but evidence is evidence, and we shall take
advantage of his if it be necessary. You can punish him—why do you not? Is it
that you fear he might blurt out something about your present intimacy with
Monsieur Louis&#39; mother and with Maxwell, who visits you disguised with false
beard and whiskers? Is it that you fear that this might lead the police to
inquire into the reasons for your association with the villain who murdered
Monsieur Morgan?&quot; And now I had the satisfaction of seeing her blanch and of
knowing that I had hit the nail on the head. &quot;It would make you in some sense an
accomplice in the crime. Do you perceive the danger that hangs over you, madame?
Do you perceive that your hatred of John Fordham may be carried too far?
Intensely disagreeable as it will be to you to assist in proving his innocence,
it is your only chance of safety. Decide for yourself; I use no persuasion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you use threats,&quot; she said, and I think, if a look from a woman&#39;s eyes
could kill, I should not be here now to tell my tale.</p>

<p>&quot;Hardly that. I have been very frank with you; if I have hurt your feelings
permit me to offer you my apologies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you require of me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;The address of Monsieur Maxwell, and of Louis Fordham and his mother,&quot; I
replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then you and your spies will trouble me no more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No more than is necessary to protect ourselves from treachery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not be dragged into your witness box,&quot; she cried. &quot;I will not—I will
not!&quot;</p>

<p>I considered a moment. If success continued to attend me—and I believed that
it would—we could dispense with her evidence. To be able to lay hands upon John
Fordham&#39;s enemies this very night was the all-important move in the game.
To-morrow they might be out of our reach, and I should be confronted with
difficulties that might be unsurmountable.</p>

<p>&quot;Every effort shall be made,&quot; I said, &quot;not to bring you forward as a
witness.&quot; And, indeed, as I spoke these words, I was penetrated by a conviction
that such evidence as she could give would be of little value; but I kept this
to myself. It is not wise to show your weak cards.</p>

<p>&quot;You promise it,&quot; she said, &quot;on your honor as a gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On my honor as a gentleman, madame,&quot; I replied, with my hand on my heart,
and repressing a smile, &quot;I promise it.&quot;</p>

<p>To my surprise she sprang to her feet; the devil within her obtained the
mastery, and I never heard the human voice express hatred so vindictively and
forcibly. The stories I had heard of the female fiend in the French Commune came
vividly to my mind; a representative stood before me in the person of Madame
Lourbet, as she hissed:</p>

<p>&quot;No, I will not help him! I would go in my holiday clothes to see him
hanged!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall not have that pleasure, madame,&quot; I said. &quot;I wish you good
evening.&quot;</p>

<p>Her fears returned. There is no weapon so effective as calmness in dealing
with hysterical natures. If you shriek, they shriek the louder; if you stand
firm, they quail.</p>

<p>&quot;What to do?&quot; she asked, showing in her face the conflicting emotions by
which she was torn.</p>

<p>&quot;To obtain a warrant for your arrest,&quot; I answered boldly. &quot;My spies will take
care that you do not escape.&quot;</p>

<p>I was half out of the room when she cried, &quot;Stop! I will do it—I will do it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know, madame,&quot; I said, appearing to hesitate. &quot;We can manage
without your aid. You shall stand in the dock by the side of your friend
Maxwell.&quot;</p>

<p>And now she was thoroughly terrified; she wept, she implored, she fell upon
her knees. It was a great victory, but though I knew I could not do without her
I did not yield easily. When I had worked her up to a proper pitch I said:</p>

<p>&quot;Rise, madame, and write the address in Finchley where I shall find your
friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are not my friends,&quot; she cried, tottering to the table on which lay
writing materials. &quot;They would ruin, they would destroy me! And you,
monsieur—you will save me? You have promised, on the honor of a gentleman. You
will save me—you will save me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will keep my promise, madame. Write—it is your only chance. You allowed
your hatred of John Fordham to carry you too far. Be thankful that I came here
as your friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I had never met these Fordhams,&quot; she said, her hands trembling as she
took up a pen, &quot;it would have been better for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would have been better for you if you had been faithful to your master,
and not entered into a conspiracy against him. We English have a proverb—honesty
is the best policy. Take it to heart, and for the future be content with making
money out of us.&quot; I looked at the address she had written, 23 Lethbridge Road,
N. W. &quot;Do they all live together, madame?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so, monsieur,&quot; she replied, and even now she made a motion, as
though she would have liked to pluck the paper from me.</p>

<p>There was no fear of my forgetting the address, and I held it out to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you wish for it back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she said with a shudder.</p>

<p>&quot;Very good. Just another word of sensible advice, madame. Keep in your shop,
and preserve silence until I bring this affair to a satisfactory conclusion. If
you stir you will be followed; if you write a letter of warning it will fall
into the hands of the police. You understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I understand.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;It only remains to me to thank you for this very pleasant interview.&quot; So I
left her, saying to myself as I rejoined Wheeler. &quot;Checkmate to Madame Lourbet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said Wheeler.</p>

<p>&quot;Success, my boy, success!&quot; I replied. &quot;The game is in our hands, but not a
moment must be lost. I am going in for desperate measures. Will you back me up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you carry a pistol?&quot; I asked, grasping his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Colt&#39;s double action revolver, six chambers,&quot; he answered, tapping the back
of his waistband. &quot;Took it to Liverpool with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. I have mine on me. I want two more men. Jack for one. Can you
recommend another?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A capital man. Pick him up in five minutes. Sure to be at home. Just
married, and in want of a job. Name, Bob Garlick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s the man for us.&quot; I hailed a growler, and Wheeler told the driver where
to go. &quot;I have screwed Maxwell&#39;s address out of Madame Lourbet,&quot; I said, as we
rattled along. &quot;You would have laughed if you had heard us argue—I fairly
frightened her. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised if he and Louis, and perhaps Louis&#39;
mother, are preparing for flight, and I hope to catch the lot to-night. There&#39;s
nothing in the last two that would warrant us in arresting them, but it is on
the cards that I shall arrest Maxwell for the murder of Morgan, whose real name
is Philip Barlow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know he murdered him? Best be sure of your ground, Godfrey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will make sure. The plan I have in my head will not fail. I never in my
life felt more confident, but everything, of course, depends upon our coming
face to face with the scoundrelly crew. We are going straight to their house,
you, I, Bob Garlick, and Jack, and then we shall see what we shall see.&quot;</p>

<p>What my plan was will presently be made clear. Sufficient now to say that we
found our new recruit at home, and that he took it as a compliment to be invited
to work with me. Jack also joined us. He was overjoyed to hear that it was not a
ghost he had seen in Finchley Road, but Louis himself in the flesh.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;ve lifted a ton weight off me, guv&#39;nor,&quot; he said. &quot;That clears me, don&#39;t
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will come out of it with flying colors, my lad,&quot; I answered, clapping
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;But &#39;ow did it happen?&quot; he asked, in wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall know soon,&quot; I said. &quot;Only keep cool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Morgan!&quot; he sighed, with genuine feeling. &quot;&#39;E was worth a &#39;undered of
sech stuck-up cads as Louis.&quot;</p>

<p>Over a hasty and ample meal, for a full stomach puts courage into a man, I
gave my recruits their instructions, and then the four of us rattled on to
Lethbridge Road. Night had fallen before we reached our destination. A dark
night, too, for which I was not sorry. Directing the cab where to wait for us,
we proceeded to the house.</p>

<p>&quot;How are we to get in?&quot; whispered Wheeler.</p>

<p>I did not answer him, but rang the bell, and gave the double rat-tat of a
messenger from the telegraph office.</p>


<hr class="chap"/>


<h2 style="margin-top:4em"><a name="confession33" href="#ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Whenever a summons of this kind is answered quickly it betokens
either that the inmates are in a nervous state or are in dread or expectation of
important news. A peaceful household takes things more calmly, and is content to
let the telegraph messenger cool his heels on the doorstep. I did not expect
this household to be at peace with itself, nor did I wish it, for such a state
of things would have augured ill for the success of my expedition. I was
therefore pleased to hear a rush of footsteps in the passage, followed by the
swift opening of the street door.</p>

<p>The woman who answered the summons held a candle in her hand, and there was
nothing particularly clever in my jumping at the conclusion that Louis&#39; mother
stood before me. Until this night I had never seen her or her son, nor, so far
as I am aware, had they seen me. I had counted upon this as of importance in the
move I was about to take. We being in the dark, and Mrs. Fordham in the light,
we had the advantage of her.</p>

<p>As she peered forward and held out her hand for the telegram, three of us
darted into the passage, Wheeler, Bob Garlick, and myself. Jack was on the watch
outside, to be called in by a whistle when he was required. Mrs. Fordham fell
back with a shriek of alarm, and a man ran out of the nearest room, crying:</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>This man had a scar on his forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Louis Fordham, I believe,&quot; I said, advancing, while Mrs. Fordham
continued to retreat.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;No.&quot; The two answers came simultaneously from the man and the woman,
the man acknowledging his name, the woman denying it.</p>

<p>We were moving slowly towards the room from which Louis had emerged, and now
reached the door. Mrs. Fordham flung herself against it, and crying, &quot;You can&#39;t
come in here—this is a private house,&quot; actually had the boldness to blow out the
candle. I could not but admire her for it, for she must have seen that there
were three of us, and pluck, especially in a woman, always commands my
admiration. But she reckoned without her host, for two bull&#39;s eye lanterns
instantly flashed their light upon her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you come to rob us?&quot; she demanded. &quot;I will call the police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Save yourself the trouble,&quot; I replied. &quot;We are officers, and I warn you not
to resist. Here is a police whistle, if you would like to use it.&quot;</p>

<p>She did not take it, and driving her and Louis before us we entered the room.
The gas was lighted there, and it was clear to see what was going on. Trunks and
bags were open, and the floor was littered with clothing and traveling
requirements, on the point of being packed away.</p>

<p>&quot;Preparing for a journey?&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn&#39;t concern you,&quot; Mrs. Fordham retorted.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it concerns you more than us,&quot; I said. &quot;I am afraid your journey will
have to be postponed.&quot; I motioned to Wheeler, and pointed to an inner door which
communicated with another apartment. &quot;See who is in there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is my bedroom,&quot; screamed Mrs. Fordham. &quot;You ruffians—how dare you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See who is in there,&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nobody there,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>We did not take her word for it. Wheeler examined the apartment, and
returning, said it was empty.</p>

<p>&quot;Whom did you expect to find?&#39; demanded Mrs. Fordham.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I give him a name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can do as you please about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I thought you wanted to know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall suffer for this,&quot; she said, but curiosity was too much for her.
&quot;Give him a name, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you say to a party of the name of Maxwell?&quot;</p>

<p>She made no answer, but I observed that her face grew suddenly white, as had
been the case with Madame Lourbet when I made a good shot. In dealing with
self-willed women this is always a satisfactory sign. My observation of the
tender sex leads me to another conclusion—the most obstinate of them when the
barriers are broken down show the most fear, and are the most subservient and
submissive, though I am bound to say this was not exactly the case with Mrs.
Fordham. But then she was an exceptional woman, and she hated John Fordham as
only a woman can hate.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is in the house besides yourselves?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have dared to molest us,&quot; she answered, &quot;if we had protectors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Answer the question,&quot; I said sternly.</p>

<p>&quot;You know that we are alone in the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go and see,&quot; I said to my two assistants. &quot;I can take care of these.&quot;</p>

<p>They departed on their errand, and until their return, when they informed me
that the house was empty except for those who were in this room, not a word was
exchanged between me and Mrs. Fordham. As for Louis, he had taken no part in the
conversation. He was evidently ruled by his mother, for he kept his eyes upon
her, and took his cue for silence from her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said I, &quot;we are here upon very serious business, and I don&#39;t want you
to incriminate yourselves. I have had an interview with one lady to-day—a friend
of yours, Madame Lourbet, provision dealer, Soho—. and after some stupid
reluctance on her part, I put it to her whether she would treat me as a friend
or an enemy. If it had been as an enemy she would have been in prison by this
time. I should have had her arrested. But she acted like a sensible woman, and
accepted me as her friend, recognizing that it was her only chance of being kept
out of the criminal dock. The consequence is, she is free—and safe.&quot; I repeated
the last two words. &quot;And safe. I offer you the same chance. If, without
incriminating yourselves, you can do as she did, I advise you to follow her
lead. If it is to be the other way, blame yourselves for the course I shall
take.&quot;</p>

<p>Louis made a motion, as though about to speak, but his mother restrained him.</p>

<p>&quot;Be silent,&quot; she said. &quot;Pray what course do you propose to take?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall arrest you, Mrs. Fordham, and you, Louis Fordham, on the charge of
complicity in the murder of a man known as Morgan, over a year ago in
Liverpool.&quot;</p>

<p>Louis staggered, and caught at the mantelpiece for support, and Mrs. Fordham
rushed to his side. I remembered what John Fordham wrote in his Confession about
the love she bore her son, and I now had evidence of it.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not very strong,&quot; I said, stating a palpable fact. &quot;Probably you
still feel the effects of the wound you received on the night Morgan was
murdered.&quot;</p>

<p>And now Louis was not to be restrained. &quot;What do you know of it?&quot; he
screamed. &quot;What do you know of it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Up to a certain point,&quot; I replied, &quot;I know everything. Of the company you
kept in Liverpool and elsewhere, of the way you spent your days and nights, of
the gambling that was going on, of your accusing Maxwell that he cheated you at
cards, of your being stabbed by him&quot;—I stopped here. I had given them an inkling
of what I did know, but had no intention of telling them what I did not know; so
I branched off on another tack. &quot;You are both aware that John Fordham is in
prison for a murder he did not commit. Your presence alone in a criminal court
will prove him to be innocent. But we do not need that to set him free; it can
be accomplished without your aid. And for the rest—well, it is in your hands. I
shall not give you long to decide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My son was a victim,&quot; said Mrs. Fordham. &quot;He is no murderer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can prove that to a judge and jury instead of to me, if you prefer it. I
have a conveyance waiting for you. Be advised. Don&#39;t trifle with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mentioned an alternative, but have not explained it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you are growing sensible. I must have plain answers to plain questions,
and a plain statement of facts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I speak privately to my son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no objection, but it must be in this room. We shall not let you out
of our sight. You can talk in the corner there, and we will remain here by the
door. If you speak low we shall not overhear you.&quot;</p>

<p>She dragged Louis into the corner, and there they held a whispered
conference. I did not seek to overhear them, but I saw that Louis, overcome by
fear, was ready, even eager, to unbosom himself. Such opposition as was apparent
to me came from her. She was the kind of woman that hates to give in—she and
Madame Lourbet would have made a pretty pair—but in the end she allowed herself
to be persuaded.</p>

<p>&quot;We will answer your questions, such as we think fit to be answered,&quot; she
said, &quot;under compulsion. Understand that—under compulsion.&quot;</p>

<p>I shook my head and smiled. &quot;That will not do. You will answer all my
questions of your own free will, or you will answer none; and your desire is to
assist the course of justice.&quot;</p>

<p>She shut her mouth with a snap, and I think she would have liked to bite me.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t answer,&quot; cried Louis, &quot;I will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Put your questions,&quot; she said, frowning at him and us.</p>

<p>&quot;You wish me to do so?&quot; I asked, knowing I had her in my power, and she was
forced to answer, &quot;Yes.&quot; She did not exactly love me at that moment.</p>

<p>I pointed to the litter of clothing and open trunks.</p>

<p>&quot;You are packing up to go away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes—we have a right to go where we please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And from there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not decided.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was your intention to travel by the night train?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who was to go with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is not a friend,&quot; Louis exclaimed, &quot;I don&#39;t care for your dark looks,
mother; I will speak! He has never been my friend. Didn&#39;t he rob me—didn&#39;t he
nearly murder me? And you stand up for him because—because——&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>But though he did not finish the sentence I did, in my mind. She stood up for
Maxwell because there was a tie between them; he had obtained a hold upon her
through her affections—for even such women as she can love. Conjectures, of
course, but I afterwards learned that they went straight to the bull&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>I continued. &quot;Maxwell was to be your companion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is coming for you? You expect him here tonight?&quot;</p>

<p>It needed but the slightest hesitation on her part to cause me to turn to
Louis, and when he answered, &quot;Yes, he is coming for us,&quot; I thought she would
have struck him.</p>

<p>&quot;Quarrel away,&quot; thought I, &quot;it all makes for us.&quot;</p>

<p>It made for us also, that she was torn two ways at once—by her undoubted love
for Louis, and by what had taken place between her and Maxwell.</p>

<p>&quot;At what time do you expect him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At ten.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at my watch; there was nearly an hour to spare.</p>

<p>&quot;When was it arranged that the three of you were to go together to the
continent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Last night, you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, last night. That is yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was Maxwell who suggested it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After he had followed a certain person home from Madame Lourbet&#39;s shop?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are well informed,&quot; said Mrs. Fordham, bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;There is very little in this rascally affair,&quot; I responded, &quot;upon which I am
not well informed, but it is always satisfactory to receive confirmation. I have
no further questions to ask at present. What I require now is a plain statement
of facts. Relate what occurred after Maxwell stabbed you.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not propose to set it down in Louis&#39; own words. Mrs. Fordham wished to
give me the information, but I would not receive it from her, although it was to
her eagerness to prove Louis&#39; innocence that I was indebted for some part of the
disclosure. For the filling in of the narrative I am also indebted to the
natural intelligence of a man who knows his business, that man, without any
affectation of false modesty, being myself. The importance of this disclosure
cannot be exaggerated. It filled up the gaps of the mystery, and made the whole
thing clear.</p>

<p>I give the incidents in the consecutive order in which they occurred.</p>

<p>When Louis fell to the ground in the house in Rye Street, Maxwell and Morgan,
believing him to be dead, stood transfixed with fear, appalled by the tragic
termination to their plan of robbery. Jack had rushed from the room in terror,
but this they scarcely noticed, so engrossed were they in fears for their own
safety. What aroused them were the sounds of a desperate fight in the passage
below—the fight that was going on between John Fordham and Jack. Their
impression was that they had been watched, and that the police were upon them.
If that were indeed the case, their peril could not have been greater, for, with
the body of their victim on the ground, they would be caught red-handed. The
conflict in the passage continued for several minutes, and it seemed as if one
or more of the combatants were endeavoring to force their way upstairs. Suddenly
there was a lull—they heard the thud of a fallen body, and then the violent
slamming of the street door. Following that, a dead silence.</p>

<p>It was long before they could muster sufficient courage to go from the room
to ascertain what had taken place. They took a light with them, and coming upon
the body of a man, they stooped to see who it was.</p>

<p>&quot;By God!&quot; cried Maxwell. &quot;It is my brother-in-law, John Fordham! How did he
come here?&quot; and then, &quot;What a slice of luck!&quot;</p>

<p>I can almost hear him utter these words as I write them down—and if he did
not utter them he thought them, which I take it amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning he saw the opportunity of diverting suspicion from
himself, and fixing the guilt upon an innocent man. Assisted by Morgan, to whom
probably he disclosed his plan, he carried Fordham&#39;s body into the room, took
the knife with which he had stabbed Louis, and put in its place the
gold-digger&#39;s knife he found in Fordham&#39;s sheath, smearing it first with blood.
Then he and Morgan removed every article which would draw suspicion upon
themselves, and stole from the house to await the issue of events. Whether they
kept watch upon the house to see what John Fordham would do—for they had
ascertained that he had only been stunned by the fall, and was certain to soon
recover his senses—or went away and returned after an interval, is not material.
Sufficient that they did return—to find John Fordham flown, and Louis still
lying on the ground in a state of insensibility, and apparently dead. But the
wound he had received was not mortal, as we know. He became conscious while
Maxwell and Morgan were quarreling. Morgan, it appears, was under the impression
that Maxwell intended to cheat him of his share of the spoil, and he was
insisting upon a fair division then and there. Maxwell refused, and a stormy
scene ensued, of which Louis was a witness, though he did not dare to stir lest
they should really make an end of him. From words, the two men came to blows,
and Maxwell was heard to threaten to serve Morgan as he had served Louis. But
Morgan, thoroughly enraged, was not to be intimidated, and a savage struggle
ensued—ending in Maxwell dealing Morgan a death stroke with the knife with which
he had stabbed Louis. In a paroxysm of fury he battered the face of the dead man
and stamped upon it; and finally overturned the heavy table upon the body, and
fled. Then Louis, fearful lest the murder would be fastened upon him, managed to
rise and stumble from the house unobserved.</p>

<p>The violence of the storm, which was raging furiously without, favored him,
and he succeeded in making his way to a common lodging-house, frequented by
thieves and men of the worst character, to whom the sight of a man who had been
engaged in a desperate fight was familiar. There he remained in hiding for a
couple of days, by which time he was strong enough to leave Liverpool and take
train to London, where he joined his mother and was nursed by her. Meanwhile
Maxwell had also returned to London, devoured by anxiety, and by curiosity to
ascertain what had become of John Fordham. After keeping quiet for a week he
paid a visit to Louis&#39; mother, and was astonished to see Louis in her house. As
may be imagined he was not cordially received, for Louis had given his mother a
true account of what had occurred.</p>

<p>At this juncture Maxwell&#39;s natural cunning—of which there are so many
instances in John Fordham&#39;s Confession—came to his aid. He professed the
greatest delight at Louis&#39; escape, and the deepest regret that he had allowed
his temper to master him in their dispute over cards. Concerning Morgan&#39;s death
he pointed out that Louis&#39; peril was no less than his own, and that, if the
worst should happen, it was not he alone who would be accused of the murder.
Naturally, he argued, Louis would throw the crime upon him, and naturally he
would throw it upon Louis. It was a fair assumption that his story would be
believed before Louis&#39; because of the wound which the latter had received, which
people would say was inflicted by Morgan while defending himself against the
attack made upon him. These arguments were strong enough to show the dangerous
position in which Louis stood in relation to the crime. Maxwell then went on to
say that their safety lay in fixing the guilt upon John Fordham, and he related
to them how that unfortunate man came to be entangled in the affair. The hatred
they bore to John Fordham induced them to listen with avidity to the villainous
proposal, and they hailed with pleasure the opportunity of being revenged upon
him.</p>

<p>&quot;He believes you to be dead,&quot; said Maxwell to Louis. &quot;Let him rest in that
belief. All you have to do is to keep quiet. If, as I suspect, he is in London,
I will track him down. By Barbara&#39;s death a large sum of money has reverted to
him. Let me but succeed in finding him, and I will bleed him of every shilling.
You need not be seen; I will do the dirty work, and you shall share the
plunder.&quot; The temptation was irresistible, and a peace was patched up between
them. By what means Maxwell discovered John Fordham in hiding in London under an
assumed name, and how he worked upon the unhappy man&#39;s feelings till the poor
fellow was beggared, is fully explained by Fordham himself in his Confession.</p>

<p>Thus, step by step, was the whole mystery revealed. I had good reason to be
satisfied with my work, though something still remained to be done.</p>

<p>When his story was finished Louis looked anxiously at me, but I was silent,
having a mind to play with him a bit.</p>

<p>&quot;It proves my innocence, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it does,&quot; I answered. &quot;The question is, will others believe it?
You see, Maxwell will stick to his story as you will stick to yours. He is not
likely to have any feeling of tenderness towards his betrayers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see what you have done, you fool!&quot; cried Mrs. Fordham. &quot;You have set
that beast John free, and you have put a halter round your neck! We have been
tricked—tricked!&quot;</p>

<p>She looked about her wildly, and Louis trembled in every limb.</p>

<p>I smiled amiably at her. &quot;In that nice Liverpool party of yours there were
four men—you, Maxwell, Morgan, and another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jack!&quot; he cried. &quot;He can prove my innocence. He saw Maxwell stab me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;he is the only man who can back up your story and save you
from Maxwell. If he could be found now, and be induced to speak the truth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He must be found,&quot; screamed Louis; &quot;he must be! For God&#39;s sake give me
something to drink, or I shall go into a fit!&quot;</p>

<p>His mother flew to the sideboard, and poured brandy into a glass, which she
held up to his chattering teeth.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the sight—I don&#39;t deny it—and had it not been that the time was
drawing near for the appearance of Maxwell upon the scene, I have no hesitation
in admitting that I should have prolonged the agony. My blood fairly boiled
within me as I gazed upon the terror-stricken wretches, and thought of the
sufferings they had inflicted upon John Fordham. I controlled my feelings,
however, and applied myself steadily to the business I had in hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Talking is dry work,&quot; I said. &quot;Being in a manner of speaking your guests, it
would be politeness on your part to pass the bottle round.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I second that,&quot; said Bob Garlick, passing his tongue over his lips.</p>

<p>The woman took no notice of the hint, but Louis stumbled eagerly forward and
held out the bottle to me. If I had not taken instant hold of it a lot of good
liquor would have been wasted, his hand was so shaky. We helped ourselves, and
felt the better for it, and then I said:</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t drink at any one&#39;s expense—except in the way of friendship—without
paying for it. I am going to pay for the drinks, and to prove to you that you
have acted wisely in trusting us. You have called your son a fool, Mrs. Fordham,
and it would be rude to contradict a lady. Perhaps he is something worse than
that, but at all events he has not been a fool tonight. Had he followed your
advice the pair of you would have seen the inside of prison walls. As it is, he
has saved you and himself. Do you think we left Jack out of the reckoning? Not a
bit of it. At this present moment he is within twenty yards of us, waiting for
orders, and it is a good job that his account of the stabbing tallies with that
we have just heard. I shouldn&#39;t like to have such a record as yours, Mr. Louis,
to my score, but there will be no charge of murder brought against you. That is
all you care for, I expect, never mind what happens to any one else.&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes literally flashed with joy when he heard this, and Mrs. Fordham drew
a long, deep breath of relief. She would have made almost any sacrifice to save
both men, but Louis came first. That is the way with mothers, even when they are
the worst of women.</p>

<p>&quot;Is the liquor paid for?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Louis replied. &quot;Take some more.&quot;</p>

<p>I put the bottle aside, and held up my hand, for just then we heard three
single raps at the street door, a short interval between each. Then, after a
longer interval, three rapid knocks.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that Maxwell&#39;s signal?&quot; I whispered. &quot;Speak low.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have to say anything? Must he hear your voice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. And I must hear his.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go and say it, and open the door, and leave the rest to us. We shall be
behind you.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not trust her even then, you see.</p>

<p>We stepped softly out of the room, Mrs. Fordham first, and we at her heels.
The passage was dark; I would not allow her to carry a light.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is there?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The answer came. &quot;All right, M.&quot;</p>

<p>She was in such a state of agitation that she fumbled at the lock. I put my
hand warningly on her shoulder, and the door was opened.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you keep me so long for?&quot; cried Maxwell, as he entered. &quot;Is that
you, Louis? Everything&#39;s ready. What the——&quot;</p>

<p>Before he could get out another word he was seized and handcuffed. I blew my
whistle, and Jack came up. Directing him in an undertone to remain in the
passage till I called for him, I followed Wheeler and Bob Garlick into the room
where they had conveyed their prisoner, Mrs. Fordham having run in first. She
was panting as though she had lost her breath. Maxwell had said nothing more in
the dark passage, his impression being, of course, that the police were upon
him, and that silence would best serve him. When I entered he was safe in the
grasp of my assistants, and was glaring at Mrs. Fordham and Louis, neither of
whom had the courage to meet his eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you searched him?&quot; I asked of my assistants. They shook their heads.
&quot;Well, let us see what he has in his pockets.&quot;</p>

<p>We turned them out, the slight resistance he was able to make being of no
avail. There was a loaded pistol, money, keys, and other oddments, and a
pocketbook, containing letters and memoranda. Some of the letters were old and
some recently written. Among the old letters were two signed by Morgan before
the Liverpool affair, the contents of which proved the association of the two
men for the purpose of robbing Louis. The recent letters were from Mrs. Fordham,
and my hurried perusal of them left no doubt as to the nature of the intimacy
between her and Maxwell. It was a ticklish position for a woman—on one side a
lover, on the other a son whom she worshiped; but she had made her choice, and
there was no retreat for her.</p>

<p>While I was examining the letters there was no sound in the room except the
rustling of the papers. The truth dawned slowly upon Maxwell, and his face grew
darker and darker as he gazed upon the forms of his confederates. He could no
longer control himself.</p>

<p>&quot;—— you all!&quot; he cried. &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are charged with the murder of a man you knew by the name of Morgan in
Liverpool,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s an infernal lie!&quot; he shouted. &quot;And you—what have you to say to it?&quot; He
addressed this question to Louis and Mrs. Fordham, but neither of the two
answered him. &quot;So,&quot; he said, between his teeth, while a deadly pallor spread
over his features, &quot;you have laid a trap for me, after all I have done to save
you. There stands the murderer&quot;—with a nod of his head towards Louis—&quot;and I am
ready to give evidence against him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of evidence?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;The evidence of an eye witness,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw him do it—saw him strike
Morgan down!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said I, and I stepped to the door, and beckoned Jack in. &quot;What do you
think of your ghost now, Jack?&quot; His face beamed, and then his eyes wandered from
Louis to Maxwell. &quot;Don&#39;t you know an old pal when you see him? But I forgot. He
has something on him which does not properly belong to him.&quot;</p>

<p>And as I spoke I plucked the false beard and whiskers from Maxwell&#39;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;Maxwell!&quot; cried Jack.</p>

<p>Then the murderer knew that the game was lost.</p>


<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:1em; margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;">
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>


<p>That very night, after lodging Maxwell in prison, and laying the information
against him, I paid a visit to Ellen Cameron. It was past midnight when I
reached her lodgings, but I knew she wouldn&#39;t mind that when she heard the news
I brought. Luckily the landlady of the house was up, or I should have had some
trouble in obtaining admittance; she had a birthday party, and they were
merrymaking. I explained to her that I had some wonderfully good news to
communicate to her lodger, and she allowed me to go to her rooms. Ellen&#39;s voice
trembled as she answered my summons at her door, and trembled more when she
heard who her visitor was. I called to her not to be frightened, but to dress
herself quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Good news!&quot; I cried. &quot;The best of good news!&quot;</p>

<p>I was soon admitted. What a picture of neatness that room was, and how sweet
and pretty Ellen looked, despite the trouble she had gone through! I declare a
lump rose in my throat as I looked at her—but there! another man had got her,
and he was worthy of her, and she of him.</p>

<p>We spoke low because her boy was asleep in the next room, and as she listened
to the story I had to relate, tears of joy ran down her beautiful face.</p>

<p>I finished, and rose to go.</p>

<p>&quot;John is to be brought up to-morrow,&quot; I said, &quot;and to-morrow he will be free.
Come to my office at half-past nine in the morning, and we will go to the court
together. I know you would like to be there to welcome him. That is one of my
reasons for coming here at such an hour. Another reason is, that I thought it
would be a sin if I lost a single minute in giving you the good news.&quot;</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees and buried her face in her hands. Tears were in my
eyes, too, as I was stealing out of the room. But she sprang to her feet and
caught my hand, and kissed it.</p>

<p>&quot;How can we repay you—how can we repay you!&quot; she sobbed.</p>

<p>&quot;I am repaid already,&quot; I said, and I pressed her hand and left her.</p>


<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:1em; margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;">
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>


<p>And indeed in one way I was more than repaid. You know the stir the case made
in the papers, and the flattering things that were said of my skill—which I am
too modest to set down here. My proceedings were not perhaps exactly regular,
and it is quite likely that Scotland Yard would rather have had the credit of
bringing the Mystery to light. I doubt if they would have succeeded had it been
left to them. And as for what I did, and the way I did it—well, nothing succeeds
like success.</p>

<p>I became famous—really. And the business that flocked upon me! I am in a fair
way of making my fortune. No need to go on the stage.</p>


<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:1em; margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;">
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>


<p>All this happened twelve months ago. John and Ellen are in Australia doing
well, and as happy as birds in summer time. We write to each other regularly,
and they are continually sending me little presents. Pleasant, isn&#39;t it, to feel
that, though many thousands of miles are between us, we shall hold one another
in affectionate remembrance to the last days of our lives?</p>

<p>And then, would you believe it, a week or two ago I was introduced to a young
lady so like Ellen that they might be sisters. The moment I set eyes on her my
heart went twenty to the dozen, and—— But that has nothing to do with the story.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; font-size:24pt">A Little Wizard</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; font-size:12pt"><b>By STANLEY J. WEYMAN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12%; font-size:10pt"><b>16mo, Cloth, 50 Cents</b></p>


<p class="p2"><b>New York Times</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">&quot;Mr. Weyman now builds his romance
on English soil. The time is the beginning of the Puritan uprising, before the
firm establishment of the Commonwealth, and the personages are Roundheads and
Cavaliers. That is to say, the small boy and his fugitive brother, who are the
most sympathetic characters in the story, represent the Royalist class, and they
are set among crack-brained fanatics, sniveling hypocrites, and sturdy,
well-meaning dissenters. There is a strong and convincing sketch of Cromwell
before he had reached the zenith of his power, which is quite in Mr. Weyman&#39;s
best vein.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">&quot;The little story, which seems to
have been intended as a boys&#39; book, is well devised and the interest is
maintained to an abrupt and startling denouement. There are no battles, but
there is an admirable description of a march of Cromwell&#39;s troops across the wet
moors, and Mr. Weyman&#39;s strong feeling for landscape effects, which so greatly
helps the interest of all his romances, pervades this little story.&quot;</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Christian Advocate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">&quot;A new historical tale by Stanley
J. Weyman is set in the time of Cromwell, just after the battles of Marston Moor
and Naseby, and before the surrender by the Scots&#39; army of Charles I. It is
called &#39;A Little Wizard,&#39; and recites incidents in the careers of two youthful
sons of a Cavalier gentleman who has sacrificed his life to the Royalist cause,
and one of whom—the Little Wizard—figures pathetically in the story, under the
care of a faithless family servitor who has sinister connections with the
Puritan Roundheads. The story has much of the literary and historic charm which
marks all of Mr. Weyman&#39;s works, and it will find many interested readers. It is
illustrated, and has a portrait of the author.&quot;</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Brooklyn Eagle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">.... &quot;&#39;A little Wizard,&#39; in a
small volume, which will be found just big enough for an evening&#39;s reading. The
author has come back to England in this narrative, which is of the time of
Cromwell. It is a fragment only, but it is like a remnant of some rich piece of
tapestry on which is found embroidered the story of some brave deed of an older
time, and so rich is it, so full of art, so vigorous with life, that the finder
mourns that the whole history is not before him.... It is to be hoped that he
will work this vein somewhat further. His picture of Cromwell in the &#39;Little
Wizard&#39; is very lifelike. One cannot help wishing that he would attempt the same
drawing on a larger canvas. It is time we had once more a story of romance and
adventure with English ground as its foothold. It would be a blessed relief from
some of the pictures of passion, pure and impure—chiefly the latter—which of
late has given rise to the question as to whether or not English reserve and
modesty has become a forgotten virtue in literature.&quot;</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Outlook</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">&quot;The artist is often revealed as
strongly in small things as in great. Mr. S. J. Weyman&#39;s &#39;The Little Wizard&#39; is
short and slight, but, within its chosen limits, is a thoroughly artistic bit of
fiction. Its hero is a little Royalist lad of the times of Charles I., who falls
among rustic fanatics and, by an odd train of events, becomes suspected of being
endowed with witch powers and of bringing a storm to hinder the march of
Cromwell&#39;s army. The brief glimpse of Cromwell himself is admirably given. The
close is dramatically managed and effective.&quot;</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Cleveland Plain Dealer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; font-size:smaller">&quot;In &#39;A little Wizard,&#39; Stanley J.
Weyman leaves his familiar French ground and locates his story in England during
the war between the Royalists and Roundheads, the tale reciting incidents in the
careers of two sons of a Cavalier gentleman who had fallen in the Royalist
cause. It is an interesting novelette that does not take long in the reading and
has no pages to be skipped on account of dullness.&quot;</p>

and to each other, proceed to the business of the occasion by falling in love
with each other and entangling themselves in divers nets of embarrassing
circumstances, settling away from the storm to a peaceful horizon of marriage at
last. It has become necessary, in these days, to indicate the exceptional and
welcome fact that this is a pure story; painting cheery pictures of normal
domestic life, and opening no side doors to encourage the stealthy adventures of
a prurient fancy. It is a novel, strictly speaking, involving neither sermon nor
